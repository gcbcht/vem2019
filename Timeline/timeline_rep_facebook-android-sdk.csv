The new Session mechanism, along with the OpenRequest allows you to set specific request codes for FB related requests, and do not rely on a private instance variable.2. What dmmiller says above is still correct, in that the SDK will just ignore requests it does not understand, so you should actually structure your code like the following, and as long as your request code doesn\'t conflict with FB\'s," everything should work as expected.

Nevermind," now the class is deprecated and I did not work with the FB SDK for some time. Glad you checked the issue (although almost 2 years after =). Cheers'""",,,,
