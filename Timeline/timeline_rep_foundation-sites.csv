foundation-sites,228,closed,body,2012-01-13 22:44:06,00:00,,,1,b'b\' The awesome Foundation library has been added to the wonderful Root\\\'s Wordpress framework (I\\\'m sure some WP gurus already knew that though). I am working on a new design and really like the Orbit slider so I decided to use it in my first attempt at laying out the design. I have been fighting with this for a few days and have been unsuccessful in my attempts to solve the issue. My slider loads, slides are shown, slide controls (left, right) are both shown and function along with the slide timer. My issue is ALL slides show concurrently. The reason I know they are running concurrent is all my slides are transparent and you can see all of them. I have read through the Orbit documentation about 26 times now and can\\\'t pinpoint my trouble. When I leave the following code within the  tags, all elements of Orbit load, except the slides:   $(window).load(function() {    $(\\\'#front-slide\\\').orbit();  });  When I add the code below into , Orbit loads along with the slides but this is when they are all displayed together. Rotation IS happening," but image number one isn\\\'t being hidden when image two is displayed. $(\\\'#front-slide\\\').orbit(); Here is my slider code (I removed the  so it\\\'ll display as I\\\'m not sure if there are any short tags to do this... div class=""row""  div id=""front-slide""  a img src=""/"" alt=""Slider 01""  /a  a img src=""/"" alt=""Slider 02""  /a  /div  /div Could this be a CSS-conflict causing this?\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

foundation-sites,228,closed,6,2012-01-13 22:44:06,1421.92,1,,,"b'b"" Hi there", I\'m not positive this is the same issue, but I can explain one way this can happen. When the animation option is set to \'fade\', the block of code [beginning at line 451 of the orbit js file]url sets the **current** slide\'s opacity to zero and then animates it back to 1 (as well as setting the z-index value to 3): There are exactly two occurrences of the word \'opacity\' in that file, both in the referenced conditional block. This means that all slides but the current slide _always have their opacity set to 1_.  When I inspect the running slider in Firebug etc, this is exactly what I seea series of slides, all of which have a style attribute containing \'opacity: 1\'. What\'s more, with the \'fade\' animation, all the slides occupy the same area on the screen (i.e. they\'re stacked, one on top of the other). This in turn means that, unless there is a background colour or background image on the slide, or unless the img element occupies the entire area of the slide, other slides _must_ be visible behind the current one. I don\'t have a remotely-accessible version, and I haven\'t yet tried to roll a patch, but I\'d start with something like thisI think it\'ll work because jQuery will start the first animate call," then move on to the next before the first is complete: It\'s likely more efficient to choose the elements to animate to transparency from this.$slides (i.e. instead of doing another collection from scratch); this is just something you might consider testing. Let me know if I can provide further info.""'",,,,,,,,

foundation-sites,228,closed,8,2012-01-13 22:44:06,7.68,,1,,b'b\' Upon testing, I am still running into the exact same issue of slides not going away, just staying stacked with their z-index changing. I think I\\\'m just going to scrap using the Orbit slider in favor of Nivo or Flex, its just becoming a headache with transparent slides and with this project, I need transparent slider images. EditI lied... I thought I changed animation to fade but it was still on horizontal slide... Upon changing to fade," the slider ""works"" semi-sort of. The loading animation is still constantly being played through the entire thing as well. I\\\'ll probably just axe the code from the stylesheet and be done with that entirely.  As for the slides... Just before slide A goes away", it\\\'s opacity goes to 0, then comes back, then the slideshow changes to slide B. Then when its time to rotate again, it\\\'s opacity goes to 0, comes back, and then before going back to slide A, it displays a blank slide (even though I only have 2 slider images setup), once it\\\'s time for another slide to come, slide A then comes back. Do you think changing the z-index to a negative number to hide behind all page elements would be a workable solution?\'',,,,,,,,,

foundation-sites,228,closed,10,2012-01-13 22:44:06,24.3,1,,,"b'b"" I\'d come to the same conclusion based on the CSSif all slides were transparent (or simply not visible)", the loading image would show. Aside from that though, the javascript kind of **looks** as though somebody either made a first attempt at making it work with transparency or anticipated that it might be needed later. The z-index bit is already present; if the only images ever visible were the currently animating-to-visible image and the currently animating-to-invisible image," then the only remaining problem would be the loading graphic which could be solved very simply in or out of Orbit. I\'ll take a shot at this a bit later today or on Monday to see if it\'s really practical.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

First, in your theme\'s CSS, add the following:  .orbit-slide { visibility: hidden; } This hides all slides by default and doesn\'t use the opacity property which isn\'t well supported in IE8. Next in the Orbit js file, around line 214, add the visibility property, as shown below. This sets the first slide to visible on initial load. Finally, around line 485," use the following to fix the animation:.  Hopefully Zurb resolves Orbit to work with transparent slide backgrounds so this fix doesn\'t have to be applied each time.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\\\'ve taken the following plugin url  and refactored it to work with multiple instances (eg, call it on multiple elements), as well as making several other changes: better handling of height calculations for mobile devicesability to hide the element when you get to the  of the parent elementfadeIn effect (instead of slide)and  support via portions of jQuery Mobile (as I also mention here: url  Since I haven\\\'t yet launched this feature someplace public I threw together a JS Bin to give a simplistic example (plus the accompanying code): url If you scroll down in the JS Bin example you should see near the top right corner and near the bottom right corner.  Neither link does anything (they\\\'re just examples).  Also, there\\\'s some weird complications with doing this in JS Bin, so the positioning is a bit funky, but on my test site everything is working properly. So my example illustrates how _I\\\'m_ intending to use this code, but it could be applied in lots of different ways, including what I think folks are asking about here in this thread.  For my purposes I\\\'m not intending to do the full width Nav and Footer that are often desired (nothing wrong with thosejust not what is needed for my current project); instead I\\\'m planning to have a Menu icon in the top-right corner that would call a Foundation Reveal (containing the Menu), and in the bottom-right a Up arrow icon that will scroll you back to the top of the page.  My plan is that these would only be displayed on mobile devices. So that\\\'s all just explaining why my example uses the particular layout that it does. I think however that this code should work decently well for things such as a Sidebar, Nav, Footer, etc.  Basically you can call the code on any element, and you use a little CSS to handle some of the positioning, but this plugin sidesteps a lot of the fixed positioning headaches that can appear on mobile devices (eg, url  because it works by changing the property of the element.  To be extra clear though, this plugin is not true fixed positioning," and is definitely _not_ the exact same thing as the Affix plugin used in Bootstrap. I think the methods used in this plugin are similar to what jQuery Mobile used once upon a time to get ""fixed"" elements (I\\\'ve not been able to wrap my brain around how they\\\'re doing things now). So I\\\'m not suggesting this plugin is appropriate for all cases.  But I thought I\\\'d share it for those for whom it might get at what they are wanting. A few final caveats", etc.:I do _not_ have access to lots of mobile devices, so ironically I\\\'ve not been able to test the plugin very much on mobile (which is the context that I\\\'m exclusively planning to use it for).  Limited testing on a few devices (both Android and iOS) have been positive though.  Also, don\\\'t use the JS Bin example for testing this particular plugin; make a test page someplace else as the JS Bin example is only approximating what I\\\'m observing elsewhere (not sure why the weirdness). If I have time perhaps I\\\'ll throw together a better example at some point.If you decide to make use of the plugin I\\\'d appreciate it if you would leave the credits referring to myself (Sean) and the original author (Yair) in the plugin. I\\\'d love to see someone take this code and further improve it (especially Zurb, making this part of Foundation). I\\\'ve had a brief email exchange with the original author about a month or so ago (asking him some questions) and he was very friendly and I would expect he would be fine with others making improvements (since he seemed fine with my doing so).  The code is still rough around the edges, and the improvements have been focused on my particular project, so undoubtedly some things could be improved for more general use.If anyone does make improvements I\\\'d just again ask that you leave the credits in the plugin referring to myself and the original author, and **also** that you share your improvements with the community.  :) I hope you all will find this helpful.  And maybe if the Zurb folks like it enough we\\\'ll see it get added (in some form) to Foundation! Sean\''

My understanding is that the CSS media queries calculate the viewport width + scrollbar in modern browsers (correctly so"," according to the spec) while the JS used only calculates the viewport width without scrollbar.  This is why you\'re getting the problems once you get within ~15px of the set breakpoint the CSS and JS values don\'t match up. To fix this I changed how the breakpoint is calculated in .  Here\'s the new version starting on line 221 for me:  gets the viewport + scrollbar width in browsers that support it matching the CSS value.  I added the conditional for IE8 support as that browser doesn\'t support innerWidth and actually calculates the viewport without the scrollbar.  Changing the <= to < ensures that the problem doesn\'t still occur precisely at your set breakpoint. If you don\'t need IE8 support you should be able to simply change $(window).width() to  in the original function.  You\'ll also want to change the <= to < as mentioned above.  Hopefully this helps someone else!""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Please fix this @zurb. **Update:** Okay", I\'ve figured out how to make this work for what I want.

The key is making sure is set **before** any Foundation functions are used (most especially **rem-calc**). This might seem obvious in hindsight, but the wording of the settings comments encourages you to move $rem-base around, and depending on where your type settings are in relation to other settings (or imports), this could happen. Then, setting (or even just  ) will do the trick to decrease your font-sizing correctly. In my case, this does not require the fixes @seantimm implemented in #2329 (and that haven\'t been merged into master yet).  Now, there will be some other settings that must be manually adjusted.

foundation-sites,2090,closed,body,2013-04-02 16:45:47,00:00,,,1,b'b\' I love Foundation 4. Beautiful, easy, semantic and intuitive. I\\\'m hoping I\\\'m doing something wrong with form elements as they make no sense, particularly the select drop-downs. I\\\'ve followed the documentation exactly. There really isn\\\'t much for the select drop-downs. They look very pretty, but aren\\\'t really functional. So I have to disable all custom forms :(. Here\\\'s the list of problems, is this expected behavior?1. Can\\\'t scroll options in a select drop-down on  (I\\\'d have to imagine this is a show stopper for so many users, makes me think I\\\'m doing this wrong)2. Can\\\'t start typing to immediately go to an option in a select drop-down3. Can\\\'t tab navigate between elements like checkboxes, selects," etc4. Doesn\\\'t use mobile browsers\\\' built-in mechanism for choosing a select option (not a big deal if choosing a select option worked) All I really do for forms is add a class called ""custom"" to the form element. Checkboxes and radio buttons require a little more custom HTML", but otherwise am I supposed to do something different? Are the above issues expected? If the above is expected, obviously I have to disable Foundation for the select drop-downs at least temporarily. Can I do this easily?\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,

And if your forms only have 2 or 3 fields," then it doesn\'t matter as much that tabbing to the next fields doesn\'t work.

So please improve it / rewrite as needed :) The idea here is to improve data-orbit-link so that it keeps up with Orbit slides. A class of \'active\' is added (and removed) from the list of data-orbit-link elements as the slides are changed. This information can then be used to visually highlight the appropriate active link as I did on url  on the Testimonials section. An even nicer visual improvement would be to immediately set the active link to the new slide as soon as it is clicked. Then animate in the new slide. Currently the slide is animated in and the appropriate link is changed after the slide has finished animating. This makes the effect appear a little laggy. However I didn\'t want to complicate the code any more until you have a look at it.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, you\'re correct about losing the expanded state if you resize to a larger size, but I think this is an edge case that we shouldn\'t add code for.  We want the top bar to work well at any size, but we shouldn\'t optimize the behavior (and add extra code) for dragging the window size back and forth.

The videos have a yellow 2-pixel border which would be my guide to make sure I wasn\'t cropping content or leaving a black border. I created a sample page with copies of the players at different sizes to try it out (the markup I used is below).

foundation-sites,3539,closed,body,2013-11-10 09:08:19,00:00,,,1,"b'b"" The [current implementation of RTL support in Foundation 4]url  is helpful mostly in documents which are uni-directional (bidi). It assumes that a document is LTR and provides the option", in SCSS, to turn the whole document RTL. In order to support bidi, Foundation 4 must not reset directionality in CSS or it must do it in a more clever way. The current implementation resets direction to LTR for all of the following elements in CSS, like so: In sites with mixed directionality (bidi) this unconditional resetting causes mayhem because it overrides the various elements\' attribute. For example, if a element in an otherwise LTR document has a attribute value, the CSS reset will override the element\'s declared direction and it will be rendered LTR. [This W3C article]url  clearly explains that directionality should be implemented in markup (if not in unicode). One such clever way may to use the following snippet instead of the on all of those elements above. It sets directionality by selecting on the attribute\'s value. It starts by setting inherited directionality and ends by setting explicit directionality. In my testing it handled the situation perfectly. Here\'s [the markup I tested it on]url  Of course, this only addresses bidi in elements which are not Foundation specific; the grid," for example. The markup I tested it on is very basic and doesn\'t include various Foundation features.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

foundation-sites,3539,closed,2,2013-11-10 09:08:19,1076.5,,,1,b'b\' Thanks for the feedback!  I\\\'ve reviewed the W3C article you linked as well as throw together a sample pen, and I\\\'m coming to a different conclusion than you have drawn regarding the kind of impact this has on the document," so I\\\'ll need further clarification. Per the document: ""The CSS2 recommendation recommends the use of markup for bidi text in HTML. In fact it goes as far as to say that conforming HTML user agents may ignore CSS bidi properties."" The [CSS property]url  sets the base text direction of block level elements", but it doesn\\\'t override everything else on the page.  You can see this is the case in [my sample pen]url  that is referencing the  and getting set  . Additionally, the direction property has an initial value of  , so even if you remove it from being set, it\\\'s still being set to  , anyway.  I really don\\\'t think there\\\'s a problem here.  If you have a specific example that demonstrates otherwise, please let me know, as I want to make sure we get this right, but I\\\'m going to close this issue for now.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,

foundation-sites,3539,closed,3,2013-11-10 09:08:19,127.5,,1,,b'b\' We don\\\'t want default framework CSS to touch directionality because it overrides markup directionality, destroying the rendering of the content. The directionality of elements, whether they be block level or inline, [should be set in **markup** only]url  This is because directionality is a content-level thing. For example, When you have a Hebrew or Arabic paragraph between some English paragraphs you\\\'d want to put on that  . Or it could be a whole and it would be inherited to all children elements. Directionality is a content-level thing. To demonstrate, I\\\'ve added a element to the pen. It has an attribute. Since Foundation overrides directionality in CSS, the rendered direction of this is  . I\\\'ve also added a with to demonstrate that it and it\\\'s children are rendered LTR. So not only in-line elements deserve to be free from CSS direction resets," but block elements as well. ""HTML user agents may ignore CSS bidi properties"" but they don\\\'t. CSS is overriding the elements\\\' attribute and this is why we shouldn\\\'t reset direction in CSS. As for your last paragraph"," The [W3 tutorial says]url  ""In HTML the base direction is either set explicitly by the nearest parent element that uses the dir attribute", or, in the absence of such an attribute, the base direction is inherited from the default direction of the document," which is left-to-right (LTR)."" So", from a coder\\\'s point of view, if the whole document is RTL, we set on the  .

The visibility loop omits classes that don\\\'t make sense. For example:**.show-for-small-down** (since small is the smallest breakpoint,"down"" is irrelevant)**.show-for-xxlarge-up** (since xxlarge is the largest breakpoint, ""up"" is irrelevant) You get the idea. I was trying to keep the list of classes lean, since there are already so many of them. But it seems like omitting those classes that don\\\'t make sense could be confusing for a user. If, for instance, I\\\'m using **.show-for-medium-down**, and I change it to **.show-for-small-down** without removing the **-down**, then I\\\'m referencing a non-existent class, and that element will always be visible. I\\\'m wondering if this is what you were running into. Something like **.hide-for-xxlarge-up** won\\\'t work, because it\\\'s omitted from the loop. Removing those exceptions will make the visibility loop simpler, but will result in more classes being generated. If this is not the issue that you were seeing, please let me know. As a side note, there are some classes in this version that could also be omitted. For example:**.show-for-small-up** (if small is the smallest breakpoint, then everything is ""up", so this class is useless)**.show-for-xxlarge-down** (if xxlarge is the largest breakpoint," then everything is ""down""", so this class is useless) These types of classes _are_ currently in this version.

So when it comes to \'where to publish\' foundation plugins, my vote is for making the location as close to zurb as possible, if your a foundation developer, then your going to come back to look at the docs from time to time, suggesting NPM or any other ephemeral language specific directory is going to make it less likely that the plugins will be surfaced. If you need inspiration look at url  Yes python packages have pypi, yes they have , yes they have an incredibly easy to search syntax that makes them easy to search for directly on github, but picking plugins should be easy to do," and a site like that would make it very easy to decide which foundation plugin you needed.

I checked the website out it\'s actually .com not .org and I do like the idea (although not their implementation that much compared to NPM). I propose creating a more advanced version of url  or url  or url  or url  with more filtering options. What they do, and note slush has relatively few packages at time of writing, is they piggyback on NPM, and query NPM for packages with a certain keyword. I would be happy to create this, if the community would be happy publishing plugins on NPM with the keyword, using url  Also I think that some functionality presently in foundation should be split up into separate modular plugins," as well as the proposed affix plugin.

foundation-sites,4710,closed,20,2014-03-17 12:06:23,928.8,,,1,b'b\' @HashanP fairly important point about why NPM may not be best. Where do non JavaScript plugins go? If I maintain a django plugin or a php module or anything other than JavaScript... Then NPM is a rather inappropriate place to store it. The nice upside of a new plugin listing is that it isn\\\'t necessarily tied to JavaScript which is why I suggested a tool like DjangoPackages," it doesn\\\'t mandate a particular package management tool chain and can act as a purely unificating force (users thinking ""if it\\\'s for foundation it belongs in the index"") as opposed to creating any more chances for valuable foundation resources to remain hidden (users thinking ""well my plugin isn\\\'t JavaScript so I\\\'m not going to package it for NPM"," I\\\'m sure if anyone wants it they can find it""). One other advantage of DjangoPackages is I don\\\'t have to be the maintainer to edit metadata or add a package I just found on GitHub", it makes the discovery, curation and new content on boarding process easier, leaving package management to the package owners discretion.  \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As you may be aware, future versions of Angular,  Ember, and other popular frameworks will be re-engineered to work better with Web components and ES6\\xe2\\x80\\x94particularly accessing and leveraging the power of observers, the Shadow DOM, the element and its and properties;  ES6 proxies, and other exciting features.  Accordingly, these things should allow Foundation for Apps to be  more framework-agnostic than when it was originally announced.  When it comes to module JS, not much work has been done towards a particular architecture for the JS associated with Foundation for Apps yet (as far as I know). That said,  it has to be done in a modular way to meet the goals of the project I\'d imagine, and the end users of the framework to make apps\\xe2\\x80\\x94developing JavaScript applications in a modular way is a common best practice by modern intermediate to advanced web developers today. ## Regarding the Dialog element @HashanP I myself have voiced support for the dialog element.  Towards the efforts of _Foundation for Sites_ being more accessible, there are in fact plans to finally implement support for the tag.  Chrome 37 and only the recent versions version of Firefox have native support for it as far as I know, but the polyfill is decent enough for it to be supported now, in my opinion.  That said, there\'s no reason for _Foundation for Apps_ to not have support for it. Reveal without the use of dialog is currently being planned to be compliant with WCAG standards, and it\'s not decided whether or not support for dialog will be implemented during the final stages of such changes or afterwards.  Being familiar with the basics of using  , considering the JS changes needed to be made (for example, reveal shouldn\'t allow other elements to be focusable when active except the address bar via esc), it\'s undecided whether support for it will be shipped within the next release or soon after the release that\'ll address accessibility woes of Foundation.  It may very well be an implementation separate from the core version of Reveal to be shipped faster.  ## Regarding Dependencies @istrasoft With a modular design, such things shouldn\'t be a problem. Given the fact evergreen browsers are only supported with Foundation for Apps," a lot of weight that was often added to Foundation for Sites to support older browsers not ideal accounting for during the prototyping stage of a web application will be dropped.""'",,

And list group, i mean, bootstrap list groups, Foundation haven\'t any like this and i think that are a beautiful and elegant solution for a index page.

It\'s very simple do it. Center-block i used one time, so, i think that will be a helper class but not important class.

foundation-sites,4791,closed,12,2014-03-25 15:56:40,385.77,1,,,"b'b"" It seems there are two issues here. First is that the browser (Chrome and Firefox tested) will scroll the page up if the bottom of the content is reached. So if your window is 900 px height and your content on one tab is 1300px", you scroll down to the bottom, then click a tab with only 800 px content, the window y position will scroll up to the top to show all 800 of the 900px.  This is likely the desired behavior in most situations.  To avoid it, there must be enough content to go beyond the height of the window on all tabs. The second issue seems to happen in Chrome, but not Firefox.   Even when there is enough content to fill the window height, Chrome will scroll to the top of the page when clicking any tab.  There is a note in the  file that seems related to this issue: When set the other way (the default it seems): Chrome will move the y position so that the hash for the content of the tab clicked is at the top of the window as far as it can go without running out of content at the bottom. Neither behavior is desirable with a horizontal row of tabs that a user may be clicking through because those tab links jump around after each click. The ideal behavior would be for the scroll to happen when deep linking to a hash anchor only if it was called from an element that _was not_ in the dd set of tabs.  For example, in the case of going back to a previous page where a deep tab was open, the window should scroll to the y position it was open at.  If a link somewhere else on the page calls to a deep link in the tabs, it would be appropriate to scroll to that tab.  But when linking from the parent set of the tab," no scroll should happen at all. This can be duplicated by reducing the height of a browser window and using the link from @fuzendesign in firefox and chrome to demo the different behaviors.  I\'m working on this issue at the moment.  But it\'s a bit beyond my skill level. So hopefully by writing it out here. Someone else might get a better grasp on the issue.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,

foundation-sites,5251,closed,7,2014-05-30 19:15:11,24.83,1,,,"b'b"" Hi", @flexbox and @chrispelzer : ## Regarding Autoprefixer Being a long-time Autoprefixer user myself (I personally use it in _all_ my projects; I also haven\'t had the need to use prefixes in an actual project for almost two years because of Autoprefixer), it was decided _not_ to include Autoprefixer for Foundation for Sites until another _major_ release after a lot of Foundation for Site users contacted us about being unable to use it for whatever reason with their setup.  Foundation for Apps will include Autoprexier, but we haven\'t decided on a specific date when we\'ll release another major release of Foundation for Sites that\'ll allow us to include Autoprefixer for Foundation for Sites without alienating a lot of users.  Given the fact Andrey Sitnik (the creator of Autoprefixer) and other contributors of the project have made it _very_ easy to use it in a variety of ways, it shouldn\'t be too hard to include it manually with your project for now.  ## Regarding Compass Compass is _much_ more than prefixes. If you _only_ use Compass for its mixins dealing with prefixes, you can definitely remove itbut that\'s unlikely if you\'re making the most out of what Compass offers people who include it with their projects.  Compass allows you to easily create and share extensions and frameworks, and so much more.  I don\'t think it makes a lot of sense to issue a ticket to remove a ticket to remove Compass solely because of prefixes. Given the fact all popular task runners such as _Gulp_ and _Grunt_ have well documented and well designed modules to use Compass within them," I think more reasons are needed from the community for us to remove Compass.

I think that the reason the background color isn\'t changing is that it doesn\'t know what $black is. I checked", and there is a line a few lines above the background color, that defines the black color. I tested your situation with the $black also uncommented, and it worked. Could you try that and let me know if it solves your problem? The other issue is that Yeti Launch isn\'t reporting the scss error of an undefined variable (or anything else). This can give the impression that scss succeeded in compiling, when in reality there is an error. We have patched this so that Yeti Launch does report scss errors . The patch is in QA right now, apologies for any trouble that has caused you. We will be releasing it as soon as we possibly can. Expect it no later than early next week. I can allow underscores in project names for future versions of yeti launch. We limited all special characters, and didn\'t consider that underscores might be something people want. Thanks for bringing that to our attention. Lastly, I agree 100%. The app should leave users with a successful outcome, and guide them through the whole process. We definitely have had some bumps during launch week, but are firmly committed to seeing them through. We want this to be an incredible resource for front end developers, and these small usability issues certainly hamstring its potential. Feedback like yours is helpful for us to bring a great product to the table," so thank you for sharing. Screenshot of the setting to also uncomment: url  Have a happy thanksgiving!

The variable curIdx holds the array position of the item the active class will be added to and if winPos < [0] is true it means that an anchor has not been reached so by changing curIdx from 0 to undefined in the if else statement it will fix the issue.

foundation-sites,7815,closed,27,2016-01-08 16:38:44,739.1,,1,,"b'b\' I am working on a Portfolio widget with the modes ""Modal""","Card"" and ""Orbit"" based on Foundation 6 for inclusion in user webpages created with Hubzilla, a decentralized and privacy respecting publishing solution. The idea is to allow an automated and hands-off portfolio for painters, photographers and other artists, with flexibility for web developers.  I am nearly done, so this will be included in Hubzilla 2.6. However, I am having some trouble with Orbit height.  Users upload their images to one or more albums with WebDAV using something like the FolderSync app on their phone or tablet, a file manager with such support or command line rsync, or simply manually uploading through the web interface. Albums are access controlled, the Internet, some group, my friends, only me and so on. Upon upload, Hubzilla will automatically create four sizes size 0 or Original size available from the file system, while size 1 large , size 2 medium and size 3 small are in the database. Widgets are created using PHP and Smarty3 templates, then included into blocks and regions in layouts using a page description language called Comanche, and then finally the layout is attached to user\\\'s webpage.  The Portfolio widget takes three parameters album, album title and mode, either Modal, Card or Orbit. Since I cannot know how each instance of the Portrait widget is used at different Hubzilla sites, I am going by the assumption images can have any width or height, and these will be square, landscape or portrait, probably all three in the same album. Modal is done, the widget fetches images from the chosen album, displays them as thumbnails and when you click them you get fullscreen mode this was very easy with Foundation 6 thanks. Card is nearly done, for some reason card-border and card-shadow seems to be missing any help on that would be appreciated. Otherwise, quite easy.  Orbit has been the most difficult to get right, and I have not done the buttons at the bottom yet, need some more Smarty3 foo there. The W3 validator also complains about buttons inside UL and the figcaption, but it works. I seem to have a handle on square and landscape images needs some more grid understanding on my part to tweak just right. However, portrait images mixed with square and landscape images are not handled well at the moment. An example is available at url  . May be #nsfw in your country (one arty 3D drawing of nude pregnant woman praying made with Makehuman and POV-Ray).  In the example page, all images are Hubzilla size 3, i.e. the small version. There is one tall portrait image, and Orbit seems to be confused about the height of the entire slideshow, taking the tallest image as its reference (?). The result is the other images are distorted and scaled into a blur.  What I would like to happen, is to be able to set a height for the slideshow using the Foundation grid, have the image height not be higher than the slideshow, and preferably scaled correctly. Is this possible?\''

But these aren\'t problems exclusive to Foundation, they\'re unfortunately just inherent to the current state of web tooling. To be sure, we\'ve been pretty heavily pushing our userbase _towards_ more modern tooling, which results in a lot of thrash. This is as opposed to more basic ways like having a straight ZIP file with precompiled CSS and JavaScript. It\'s still possible to use Foundation without all of the bells and whistles, but our documentation tends to skew more towards advanced developers. We\'ve been having some internal discussions on how we position Foundation, and if we\'re neglecting the basics more than we think.

foundation-sites,8203,closed,5,2016-02-19 16:07:34,107.98,1,,,b'b\' As to feedback," I did read ""how to upgrade"" before upgrading my existing project. I jumped to that part of the document to carefully read those parts and execute what they were saying", then returned to the top. Normally, from my understanding,"bower update"" would be the way to do the update, but instead you seemed to be indicating that npm install foundation-sites@beta would do the update. So I tried it, but it did not update my code. I decided to just merge in the changes by comparing the Foundation-sites equivalent folder in 6.2.0 RC1 and my zurb template equivalent folder. I noted that the  and  were not part of the zurb template foundation-sites structure, so I didn\\\'t know what to do with them, leaving them in place in the foundation-sites origin. I tried foundation watch  after the merge, and I don\\\'t recall what errors caused me to think I needed to move those two files up to the zurb template root (renaming the old ), but I did, and that is when I got the parse errors indicated. So I\\\'ve since moved the 2 files back into the foundation-sites folder and reverted to the original  associated with zurb template. This seems to have gotten me further down the road, but still new problems. Upon executing foundation watch, I now get errors indicating that rem-calc is being passed ""small 20px"" which is not a number, but I can assure you that I\\\'m not passing that anywhere in my code, only  alphas\\xe2\\x80\\xa6. Resulting in the  is not being compiled. Please enlighten me if you know what would be causing this. My searches have turned up nothing. I\\\'m also getting notice further down in the terminal output: [BABEL] Note: The code generator has deoptimized the styling of \\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\xa6."" as it exceeds the max of ""100KB"". The end result is that appears to be watching and serving files from ""dist"" but my zurb template based page is no longer styled or js\\\'d. Go figure, this is my result of ""updating"" to 6.2rc. As I said. These are the types of frustrations that have haunted me throughout my ""modern tooling"" with Foundation 6.x. Regarding your general comments about the state of modern tooling, I\\\'m not the only one questioning whether the current node package dependency-crazy tooling (especially on Windows it would seem) is a step forward due to the level of chaos inherent in it. It does make me consider strongly going back to a standard compiler such as pre-pros even though I like others, want to stay on the leading edge\\xe2\\x80\\xa6.and yes, I understand that pre-pros has nowhere near the utility (like uncss, etc.), assuming that the utility is actually functional instead of just a perpetual headache. Regarding your comment about your ""documentation tends to skew more towards advanced developers,"" I think it always pays to remember that because you\\\'re paid to work on the tooling  and the framework all day long, those who are trying to use it are not, which can cause you to lose site of the forest. Developers like myself are resorting to a framework as a means to an end, and we are de facto generalists because we have such broad roles and responsibilities that there is no way that we can be as deep into the tooling and the technologies behind it as you are. So you do indeed tend to make too many assumptions in conveying many of the basics because you are ""soaking in it", whereas people like myself are a single  covering an entire 10 person team\\\'s responsibilities, on 5 different sites. It is not as if we wouldn\\\'t prefer to stop the world and go deeper than our jobs allow us to, but sheer constraint of unrealistic job scope prevents that. So I would caution you not to be condescending when thinking about your users. With all of the above said, can you help me to remain on 6.2rc and get past these compiling errors, or should I revert so that I can get back to work? Please respond ASAP.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Could you post a full stack trace of the error?3. For the Babel error, try placing _above_ in your Gulpfile. The upgrade guide will be updated to reflect this. Regarding the documentation, you\'re absolutely right.

You can even see this on the [landing page]url  for Sites\\xe2\\x80\\x94it talks a lot about new features, or how our framework is different from others, or advanced stuff, but not enough time talking about _what a framework actually is_.

Their previous (and untouched) value was as such: Changing the value to: $grid-column-gutter: 20px;did indeed resolve the rem-calc error, which begs the question of why these instructions are being given to your users if they\\\'ve not been tested.  I moved .pipe(babel()) above .pipe(concat()) which had the same result of complaining about the 100KB max, but at least with the rem-calc error gone now I\\\'m able to move forward since the page is now rendering.  So this does underscore the frustrations that users such as [Russel Porosky]url  have been venting. All of this has taken 2 full days of my time this week that I was not getting anything productive done towards MY goals and work.  I appreciate your help today Geoff, and I appreciate your comments recognizing my effort. However, I\\\'ll have to say that I feel like I\\\'m doing someone else\\\'s job here, crossing i\\\'s and dotting t\\\'s rather than confirming something that has already been tested. If that was your intent of asking people to test a release candidate, then I think that is the wrong approach. If you\\\'re going to ask, I believe the code should be tested first. For those that wish to be developers on your project, that\\\'s one thing, but for those that are simply trying to get work done using your project, that is quite another. I think you have to differentiate. Since at least I\\\'m rendering now, I\\\'ll just close this and wait for the release to get rid of the Babel error.

That is", opening a reveal causes focus to be lost on input\'s that exist outside of the reveal. I\'ve forked the original pen from this issue to reproduce the problem, url  This pen changes to the official foundation version and adds in motion-ui animation on reveal open. When the reveal is animated open changing focus on the open event no longer works because the open event is called after the animation completes. The callback therefore occurs outside of the click event stack and the browser then ignores the javascript focus request. I think we could fix this in one of two ways.1. In the Reveal do not set the focus, i.e. starting at :259 on master:  // handle accessibility  this.$element  .attr({    \'aria-hidden\': false,    \'tabindex\': -1  })  .focus(); // Remove this call The focus is taken for accessibility reasons. So rather than outright removal, perhaps we add a condition on this behaviour (not ideal), so that the focus is assigned to a specified element, e.g. data-open-focus.1. Add a before open event for the reveal where we can set the focus before the animation occurs. Which opens a larger design question as I believe there are no other \'before\' events in Foundation. In the meantime I have two potential workarounds, I can patch foundation to remove the focus (accessibility is not important for our user base, yet)," or disable the animation until this is fixed.

So technically speaking, this is a mutate event, but sticky can\'t / won\'t react to it because it is removed. The only thing that would react to mutate is off-canvas, since all the new DOM elements are loaded into it\'s container. @phifa is correct in trying to (re)initalize any plugin, however...

This reminds me of a previous issue: Headers used to have an explicit color. We switched to so that nested components with different  colors wouldn\\\'t need to each declare specific header colors.  But this is more complicated with links. The nature of cascade works against us here. Since we\\\'re applying a specific color to links, a component which needs a different link color must have a rule with more specificity for its links. And this new rule will cascade to all components within. So, if a further-nested component needs a different link color," it must have a rule with _even more_ specificity for its links. And links continue to require greater and greater specificity for each level of nesting.  I\\\'d suggest that we support setting a link color for callouts and note in the docs that ""because of the nature of cascade"," callouts with nested components require app-specific styling to reset those components\\\' link colors."" \''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

An option might have, say, as a default value and then something else like a function or string as an example.  **Edit:** I was going to suggest ditching the table for the list of plugin options (because having a default + example would make it crowded), and giving each option its own section, with more room for explanatory text.

Foundation has sensible defaults for spacing between components, so I feel like if you\'re at the point of needing to fine-tune spacing, you\'re past prototyping and into implementing a design. (I\'m sure someone could give an example of where these classes would be useful in the  phase, however!) Including certain features only in the CSS version might prove too confusing. The distinction between the Sass and CSS flavors of Foundation is not always telegraphed super clear in the documentation, but one thing is constant: the Sass version has *more* features than the CSS version. Would things get too weird if the Sass version had some exclusive features, and the CSS version had some exclusive features also?  In general, I don\'t consider it a good practice. I think there are useful arguments to be made in favor of using layout classes like and such in production, but I can\'t think of any for numeric spacing classes. The prototyping angle I almost get, but I\'d like to hear an example of where such fine-tuning was necessary to sell an HTML prototype.  If there was enough demand," perhaps a contributor could produce a small library for people to install separately.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,

To give a little more about my personal experience", we\'ve had devs help with scaffolding as we wrap visuals and interactions with client projects.

You want to make the 3rd row with have negative margins too, but it does not have anything to do with  , this is a behavior you expect from any nested row.  Despite of the name (let\'s say we use instead of  ), the problem is we\'re f*** by specificity (again, huh ?). Adding an other modifier do the job for this particular situations, but will create more problems for tons of other situations.  So, for now, I only have a bad solution: Ensure both and is aligned (negative margins). This increase the specificity, complexify the behavior, this is nothing but a hack for a badly declared  ," but... this is what any API base with an uncontrolled specificity will always leads to. And it\'s in these cases we understand the best how much an architecture that lead to nothing but bad solutions is broken.  Let me know what you think about it.""'",,,,,,,,,,,

It just bothers me to think of weird loop hacks to workaround Sass\' shortcomings... Why? Because it\'s popular. So is PostCSS, and it has all the power of JS.   A completely separate reason for PostCSS would be that there are more devs moving to CSS-in-JS than there are devs hanging out around the Sass ecosystem.  If you write the JS in PostCSS, people can use it in whatever frontend they want like. They can also just import what they need instead of the whole framework.   You can reuse a lot of the same JS to generate custom dist stylesheets.  So far as people who don\'t use CSS-in-JS, we could _still_ rely on the same parts of a single codebase, just a different API (that would be consistent throughout every preprocessor and vanilla CSS):    Yes, it\'d be challenging.  Yes, it\'s possible and I think it\'s the best solution as opposed to sticking with weaker tech for popularity that _will_ fade as more-and-more frontend devs get CTO positions and make CSS-in-JS mandatory.  tbh, I\'m not sure when you\'re planning to release your next version so it might not make sense to table-flip if it\'s just around the corner, but I think these arguments are valid for the future," or other framework authors.""'",,,,,,,,,,

In the grand picture, I am super keen to be using cssgrid more _today_, but increasingly I\'ve come to ponder how much of a framework is actually needed to implement cssgrid part of it\'s appeal is to make frameworks redundant. But what I have wanted the most out of a framework is a way to manage fallbacks for cssgrid.  (Hence the attraction of this discussion).  CSS Grid should be encouraging us to do far more interesting things than the narrow range of 12 col  modular layouts we\'ve gotten used to.  The simplest legacy encompassing solution is to support IE via a single column (mobile-esque) layout, and go to town for with cssgrid for modern browsers.  Sooner or later that is what we will ALL be doing.  But if we still have to do better for IE todau," then managing fallbacks more generously seems to me to be a good use case for grid frameworks in 2017.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Flex is a decent layout system but it is not a grid fallback no matter how you bend it. Also, on the topic of IE support I\'d discountinue it. It\'s unfortunately a browser that lost all support even within MS so if enterprise wants to stick with it in their internal environments for whatever reason they should find their own ways. Modern websites are going forward. It\'s a bit different with custom web apps when you have a client on the other side and if you have a client that demands IE support you need to communicate to them what that means in terms of development so all in all supporting old tech costs more. These decisions are pretty much made case by case and that\'s why you should not base you next CSS framework on it. Otoh, someone already mentioned that CSS grid makes the case for custom frameworks less viable because it solves the grid problem by itself.

I use Foundation, because I want a framework to make \'my live easier\' and to not have to invent everything myself, to create solid code that works on all browsers, is responsive etc., looks great, gives me freedom to Develop and Design. To combine  that work well together. To have elements that are a family in terms of look and feel and workflow. Foundation7 could still provide that including \'a grid\'. Not by using old grids or developing new grids, but by providing (probably) a couple of decent standard (grid-mixins) sets to very easily start working from based on the CSS grid. And build all other and new components based on the CSS grid. Foundation is great when I need an easy to use mixin for some element. Especially if that element uses the same \'engine\' and \'specs\' as the grid and other components it is relating to.  For Compatibility: if Foundation v7 would provide a \'rebuild\' of the current float+xy-grid but now as a \'wrapper\' component using the CSS grid als base and without changing the names and behavior in html, that would be great for . I don\'t have to start re-writing html in hundreds of sites (again), I can just upload Fv7 and continue updates and development from then on using F7 and the CSS grid as a base. So all the names and labels and behavior stays the same. As a start... Maybe a whole set of grid components is needed for it or interesting or possible... Just build and provide them mixins. Or the possibility to play around with the options as a F7 user. Again: I use a framework to make live more pleasant and easy. Not to spend more time on updating code on a framework that delivers an update that is not compatible. Continuity is also important.  So yes, ditch the \'self  grids\' and incorporate the CSS grid as new css language in the framework making great components as usual: grid (CSS grid mixin!), form, buttons, cards, tabs, etc. In the end it is all about \'content management and positioning\' in elements wether a grid," or card or a top-bar or even a button.

I ended up making [some custom testing function]url  so I could make [an and some styles]url  once they looked correct," I\\\'d  their CSS to what I call [a ""lockfile""]url Now when I run my test suite", it will compile each feature\\\'s []url  to []url  then compare  to the  in that folder.  If the tests pass, then that means I didn\\\'t break something.  That said, I only added a handful of tests because I was more interested in making the testing framework than I was actually writing boring-ass tests," but it seems to be a really nice setup for keeping all the functionality of the system isolated with visual AND unit tests (""feature"" dirs) that can be  in a minute...  Not sure if this is a pre-existing pattern and I\\\'m showing my testing newbery", but it seems to work really well.  I\\\'ve also got it setup where it\\\'ll watch these with BrowserSync so I can add them and tweak things until they work, which is pretty handy for adding new features.  You guys already seem to have some Sass testing stuff. I\\\'m too lazy to compare and contrast, but you could have one of your devs compare the two and see which you like better.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,

It relies on (which is definitely a devDependency) and side-effects created by [what-input]url  We do not require  . Foundation works fine without it. We do not import directly. We only need for tests in browser (so it is at least a  ).  ### The question Can be considered as a peerDependency so the user can choose if it is installed and what version to install ? Otherwise," should we care about the ""browser environement"" of our users and try to reduce the number of dependencies that would be finally required by its project ? Or is it ""not our job"" and should we not require at all", preventing npm to detect when the user-installed version of is incompatible with Foundation ?  I feels like there is a missing concept," like but not made for plugins (that ""require"" the main package to be installed by the top user to works) but for packages that can be (or not) installed by the end-user", that we may use directly or indirectly (side-effects in the browser), but that we can also ignore and still works well.> External dependencies (externalDependencies field in ) are dependencies that are not required to use your package but are used for progressive enhancement.
