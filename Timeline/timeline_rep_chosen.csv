As I mentioned in other threads, I do think that this is the best implementation of option adding that\'s been made available to Chosen. The interface for actually adding something to the list makes sense to someone using it for the first time and the code fits well into the existing structure. That being said, this kind of functionality sits right on the edge of the kinds of things I think are appropriate for Chosen. When we built Chosen initially, it was a with the mindset that HTML select boxes suck and we should do something to make them better. To date, almost all features that have been added to Chosen can be described as (a) mimicking standard HTML select box behavior or (b) improving the interface for existing select box behavior. Adding options, while really useful, is obviously not something a normal select box can do. In fact, the entire purpose of a select box is to give a user a defined set of choices.  If and when this gets merged, it adds another level of code debt to Chosen. Every feature or option that gets added comes with a new requirement for click testing and code that grows slightly more brittle. We need to be 100% certain that it\'s the right fit for Chosen before we commit to maintaining that debt. The really good news is that, thanks to @koenpunt and the magic of Git, you don\'t need to wait for us to mrege in order to use this. Koen\'s fork is available right now for anyone who wants to use it in their project. I know it\'s frustrating to watch something just sit without word from the project maintainers like this. In the last month, we\'ve put a ton of work and time into cleaning up the Chosen repo (just look at our [pulse]url  so we could really focus on the bigger picture feature decisions. With some of the noise cleared," hopefully we can focus on things like this and work on making Chosen even better than ever.""'",,,,
chosen,166,open,105,2011-08-07 17:22:00,1275.6,,,1,"b'b"" While I agree with the points @pfiller has made", I think there is a bigger issue here: Has chosen, or the communities need from chosen, outgrown the project\'s initial scope?  This is a great problem to have in my opinion but at this point, there is a decision to be made.  Do you keep things as they were intended, HTML select boxes suck and you address only that, or do you grow the project based on demand?  I\'m not one to make this decision of course but as an outside observer, one that happens to need this feature like the countless others, I think this is the point things are at.  The reason I believe this is because the feature being requested is such a highly  feature that if chosen doesn\'t address this feature itself, forks will happen and users will be in a bind: Choose the official, up to date project without the feature you need (requiring you to roll your own to get the feature) or choose the potentially out of date fork that adds this one extra feature. Now, this is just my opinion and it was not intended to convince or argue a point or anything like that, just trying to paint the picture as I see it.  I happen to be new to chosen myself and I came across this project trying to find a widget similar to Jira\'s labels  StackOverflow\'s tags .  Chosen\'s functionality and aesthetics are spot on for such a component other than the feature being requested.  I\'m sure others got here looking for some similar type of component. Now, that being said," what can we (the OSS community) do to help you make this decision?  You don\'t have to do this all yourself if you don\'t want to.""'",,,

What I am suggesting is that project owner already corrects his stance which is simply wrong.  I.e. if he doesn\\\'t want this feature in because ""select UI elements _conceptually_ shouldn\\\'t have ability to add new items""", then expose appropriate events and properties (which _conceptually_ should be part of any well implement select UI element.. and for your plugin they need to expose just few of those) and allow implementation of add new item that way. Project owner gets his _conceptual_ cohesion, you get to cleanly implement add new item and stop merging, and us poor souls that are trying to use this component in their projects get to save some time instead of manually merging your changes / trying to compile on their own whenever main branch advances. ... And let that be it from me I\\\'ll stop bothering you guys with messages on this pull.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,

CSS:  .chosen-container-multi -choices:after {   content: \\\'\\\';   background-image: url(chosen-);   background-position-x: 0px;   background-position-y: 2px;   display: block;   position: absolute;   top: 0;   right: 0;   width: 18px;   height: 25px;   cursor: pointer; }  .chosen-containerwith-drop -choices:after {   background-position-x: -18px; } The above will make the arrow appear in the correct orientation depending on whether the drop list is open or closed.

The option is selected and focus remains on the select I expect the focus to move to the next input field, as happens on the third row of normal (non-chosen) selects. Pressing tab while inside a single select should select the option _and move to the next input_. The problem gets worse w/o tabindex. Then after using a second tab (to move to the next input), focus is gone first, a third tab is needed to go to the next input. I\'m experiencing this on Ubuntu 14.04 with Firefox 39.

I am not a JavaScript expert, but my solution seems to work (for single select).If you like to integrate the solution, you may add an option for switching between original menu positioning and absolute menu positioning. Also, I added two more options:a placeholder to be used in  of the search.  \'placeholder\' is HTML5. Many browser due not support it yet.

I wanted to keep the changes minimal. The general idea for changing classes is the same as jquery-ui and other plug-ins. The only changes I made were to leverage the existing ui-widget-... and ui-state-XXX classes. Since I am only using chosen for multi-select dropdown, I did not complete anything I was not needing. Almost all of the changes I made to the js file are similar to: &#45;  no_results_html = $(&apos;&lt;li class=&quot;no-results&quot;&gt;&apos +  + &apos; &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&apos;);&#43;  no_results_html = $(&apos;&lt;li class=&quot;no-results ui-state-error&quot;&gt;&apos; +  + &apos; &quot;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&apos;); Thus, the behavior is the same, just the rendering is slightly different IF the classes are defined. If not, then the original non-JQ-ui css is used. For the  file, I pretty much removed anything that had a specific color or background. Layout remains unchanged. In all," I\\\'ve changed maybe 30 lines and it looks great and nothing seems out of place despite my picking ""froggy"" theme to help me easily identify errors. In fact", using froggy made it easy to spot the incompatibility since it has white text. The result was white on white in the listbox. ![screen shot 2014-07-19 at 9 35 51 am]url \'',,,,,,,,,
