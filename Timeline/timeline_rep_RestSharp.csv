This resolves most of the binding redirect pains of using RestSharp. Of course," it\'s a one-time breaking change.

RestSharp,216,closed,6,2012-02-05 00:13:49,701.73,,1,,"b'b"" Strong names only cause a problem when they are not used properly. Unfortunately it\'s also easy to misuse them. However", we can\'t forget the following.1. Strong-named assemblies can be used by applications that do not have strong names.2. Assemblies without a strong name **cannot** be used by assemblies that **do** have a strong name.3. Many applications which are otherwise highly extensible, such as Microsoft Visual Studio, use strong named assemblies. Failing to use strong names for an assembly distributed through NuGet is detrimental to overall usefulness of the package. The solution is simple: understand the limitations of strong names and develop a breaking changes policy and NuGet package specification which eliminates the problems typically associated with strong named assemblies.1. Configure your package to use a strong name.2. Use ranged version specifications for your NuGet specification and dependencies. For example, you could say that packages released in the range will use the same strong name.3. Specify the  ,  , and  . Only alter the when you change the minor version of your assembly, because this value _changes the strong name_. All versions in the range (per the above example) would only change the values of the and  .4. ~~If you ship separate assemblies targeting different versions of the .NET Framework," use separate values for the in each of those assemblies to support property SxS loading of the strong named assembly.~~ Edit: In many cases it\'s possible to avoid problems by simply ensuring that the public API surface of libraries that target different framework versions are identical.5. Do not include any changes in the range which result in a _binary_ incompatibility for assemblies referencing version 1.0. Avoid changes in this range which result in a _source code_ incompatibility.""'"

Indeed, I noticed that most of the Portable files are identical to the Non-Portable ones, but the copies on the portable branch are currently outdated (eg: Authenticators / Serializers / Deserializers / SimpleJson / Extensions / Validation) so, it makes sense to me to change those files to linked files.
