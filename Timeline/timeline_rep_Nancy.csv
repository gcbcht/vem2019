Currently your pull request includes someone else\\\'s changes and, yes," that means if we pull this in we pull the other one in too (you can see that from the ""diff"" button at the top and the fact your merge is part of the commit history in the pull) The workflow page in the wiki should tell you everything you need to know from a git perspective for creating a pull request.

Contributions to the Nancy code should always be based on the Nancy core it self. If you want to fork and assemble your own version of Nancy then you are free to do so, but please be aware that no considerations will be taken to such forks in the sense of forward comparability. We can at any moment introduce breaking changes in Nancy (even though we try really hard not to) have have intentionally left Nancy at >1.0  because we follow Semantic Versioning url  and one we hit 1.0 out API will be more set in stone. In the long run I am pretty sure it will be easier for you to follow the master branch and contribute any changes you might need if you want to be able to keep up with our changes.

Here is a transcript of our chat on Jabbr for reference: liddellj1: @Grumpydev got your reply to url  I\\\'ll describe my scenario, and why it\\\'s not working. Maybe I\\\'m doing something nuts. I am trying to support a PATCH endpoint to which I can send JSON data with a variety of optional fields. My approach is as follows:Create a custom resource class which tracks when a property setter is called, so I can query which fields were present in the JSON.Create a custom IBodyDeserializer which inspects the request and populates the above resource class appropriately. This falls down because in DefaultBinder, the instance returned from my IBodyDeserializer is not used, but instead a new instance is created, and the code which copies properties from the original instance to the new one causes every property setter to be called, so I lose the information which tells me which fields were present in the original JSON. I could of course implement my own binder, but it doesn\\\'t feel intuitive to me that the instance returned from the IBodyDeserializer is not used. It almost seems like it\\\'s set up that way to support the case where the data picked up by the binder is merged with an existing instance (BindTo vs Bind). Thoughts? 8:51:26 AM A new BindingConfig option? 8:53:27 AM Grumpydev:possibly," like a ""direct bind"" or ""deserialiser only"" or something 8:53:49 AM liddellj1:I thought that  might do what I wanted", but it doesn\\\'t  8:55:42 AM Grumpydev:no, it still has to respect the blacklist 8:57:19 AM liddellj1:Hmm. Just had an idea. In my IBodyDeserializer, I have access to the binding context, so I could just populate the blacklist in the binder to correspond to the fields that are detected in the JSON. Does that sound hacky? Sorry meant the inverse, populate the blacklist to correspond to the fields _not_ present in the JSON. 8:59:30 AM Grumpydev:that should work.. I thikn  hacky, yes, but shoudl work  9:01:01 AM \'',

A route declaration in Nancy (this is only slightly true, keep reading) is a property call (Get etc are properties that returns an item with an indexer on), and you can only put attributes on declarations, not call operations. That said, this only holds true for the **default** implementation of the interface (the default implementation being the class). You can provide alternative implementations, such as we have done in our demo url  where we created a new base class, called the [UglifiedNancyModule]url  which base its route declarations on methods, like  . You could create your own, similar implementation, and have your read the metadata of your method declarations. Personally I think the inline approach is only viable for the simplest form of documentation. As soon as you want to include a bit more verbose description, return values, exceptions, code samples etc. then it\'s going to be very clunky to keep inline. I am more a fan of declaring these separate to my routes so I can easily manage them independently of you routes.

This approach allows basic information to be obtained through the  , which can then be optionally enriched when the route is defined. Through extension methods on you can provide a nice syntax for doing so. I thought it would be best to discuss the general approach here before I take it much further. Things I\'m currently uncomfortable with:Introducing the parameter to the route definitions requires passing in nulls to invoke to correct overload, otherwise the compiler couldn\'t distinguish between the existing parameters and a new parameter.I think I agree with @jchannon there seems to be a lot of overlap between route descriptions and route metadata.

As per @thecodejunkie\'s suggestion if we separate the job of _describing_ metadata from _rendering_ it, then the metadata module approach discussed in this thread becomes one possible method of _describing_ metadata. The work I have ongoing against @khellang\'s  repo makes use of the IRouteMetadataProvider infrastructure to obtain the metadata, so it doesn\'t care how the metadata is described. Perhaps a good way forward would be to turn the smart attribute based approach of describing metadata you have developed into an alternate package (?) which could then potentially be used to describe _any_ type of metadata. If that package resulted in an alternate implementation of IRouteMetadataProvider, it would allow that package to be used outside the context of Swagger for other API formats. We could then pool our efforts together to make a  implementation which makes use of IRouteMetadataProvider to obtain metadata," thereby allowing people to choose how they want to describe their metadata.

I\'ll unlist the versions I pushed, and I\'m willing to handover the ownership of the nuget package name.

The other things you mention (NancyApiDiscoverer , AppDomainAssemblyTypeScanner, TinyIoCContainer) are implementation details within the package and can (will) be changed. As far I can see it does not force any kind of method syntax. But I agree with you guys, the package really targets Swagger and it differs pretty much from the RouteMetadata direction.

I\'ve replicated the issue by creating a simple Nancy app, adding a Dapper call with a simulated \'long\' query.  When i hit the URL in the browser, then _stop_ the request, i would expect the cancellation to be triggered, and the Dapper query to be cancelled.  ### Steps to Reproduce 1. Create a new Nancy web application () 2. Add the following code ( ):   3. Run SQL profiler on your DB 4. Run the site, and hit the endpoint. 5. After a few secs, _cancel_ the browser request by using the cross action, or closing the browser etc 6. The query still runs for the full 60 secs.  If i add a manual with a of say, a few seconds, it works fine and the query is cancelled in SQL profiler. So not sure why the Nancy isn\'t triggered the same way when the browser stops the event.  ### System Configuration Nancy version: 1.4.4 Nancy host []  [x] OWIN [ ] Self-Hosted [ ] Other: Other Nancy packages and versions: Environment (Operating system," version and so on): Windows .NET Framework version: 4.7 Additional information: ""'",,,,,

Our OWIN bridge does pick up a passed in from the environment variable url  and passes into Nancy url  during request handling.  So it really comes down to how your underlying OWIN server handels browser cancellation. So you need to read up on your server to see if it has that capability (for instance  Core won\\\'t support it until 2.0). \''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
