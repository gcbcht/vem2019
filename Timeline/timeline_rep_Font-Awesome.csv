I wasn\'t trying to be rude to @tagliala but simply pointing out that I agree that making bizarre icons for myself would be a good idea. But the icon being requested here over and over isn\'t bizarre.  @respectyoda  You\'re absolutely right. Patience is something that not a lot of people have. But do you really think that I\'ve waited for 30 seconds", or are you just saying words to have them said?

I personally think the current and icons need to have spacing to the right build into the glyph itself. Imagine toggling between off state. You\'d use and as the two states. The icon would then jump inside of the button because of different widths (assuming they\'d be centered inside of the button). To sum it up: all three (or then four) volume icons should have the same width. When stacking them on top of each other the speakers should align. I don\'t see any workaround to get this done with CSS"," as the the different widths of the glyph are basically magic numbers.

Creative Commons on the other hand applies to a large amount of media in a large amount of contexts. Just as \\xe2\\x84\\xa2 or \\xc2\\xae can be applied to any work", Creative Commons licenses have the same scope.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

See url Rule 3, ""+1"":  searching the page for ""+1"" gives 57 matches  it is the [12th most commented issue]url  out of 2.469 open onesRule 4, ""single icon"":  this is a request for several icons, however CC icons are used together, side by side, to form a single ""complex"" icon, depending on the license variation. See url if it would really help, this request can easily be split into several requestsRule 5: CC icons are already created, provided by the CC organization, as a [TTF font]url so there is no design nor font forging work to do.  In addition, @mattl offered help as Tech Lead at CC, see url  ## Next step My understanding is that the next step is a ""go"" or ""no go"" decision from the Font Awesome project leaders. In case of positive answer, then would come the integration work.\''

Font-Awesome,589,closed,body,2012-12-20 18:03:42,00:00,,,1,b'b\' I\\\'d like to suggest adding GSUB rules for all the entities in your font," so that typing the word ""icon-flickr-sign""", for instance, is substituted with the icon for it from the private use area by intelligent font engines. That way the font can be deployed in a much wider context, and you don\\\'t have to write PUA codepoints yourself, the font will make sure the right thing happens.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Font-Awesome,589,closed,2,2012-12-20 18:03:42,181.25,,,1,b'b\' Nothing like that, It\\\'s an OpenType font thing, and fonts have been able to pull off this trick for a while (you just rarely hear about it, because most of the time it\\\'s for things you don\\\'t really think about," like character substitution in arabian writing so the right letters are used at different positions in a word). You can set up a GSUB table (""global substitution"") that is the fancier version of ligatures tables. Instead of blindly turning multiple letters", like f+f, into single other letters, like the ff ligature, you can use the GSUB table to make the font replace specific sequences of unicode with other sequences of unicode instead (of any length). This means that things like icon replacements become really cool: we can leave it to the font entirely, and we never have to actually use a character map or a lookup page to find the right icon to copy-paste: the font\\\'ll do it for us as long as we type the right words.  For instance," you could have a GSUB rule that says ""if I am used to render the character sequence \\\'icon-flickr-sign\\\' then replace that string with the Private Use Area glyph 17 and render that instead"". Now all we have to do is apply the font to a div"," and if it contains the word ""icon-flickr-sign""", bam! icon. Without any hassle. OSX, Windows and _n_x all understand OpenType fonts, and all browsers do too (within the limitations of their implementation of webfonts of course, like IE wanting an .eot extension), so no worries there (note that both .ttf and .otf are OpenType fonts, they follow the same spec but use different outline vector procedures, so despite the extension suggesting that the .ttf is a TrueType font, it\\\'s actually an OpenType font with TrueType outlines, supporting all the goodness OpenType fonts let us exploit =) For an example of how awesome this is, check out the FF Chartwell font, url  which uses OpenType features to turn normally typed numbers into full blown charts.

It depends a little on how the CSS resolves if the stylesheet loads first, with time to set up a font listener on the FontAwesome resources before those get loaded in (so not first, then rest of CSS), then CSS can kick in before the content starts to show up, with correctional CSS kicking in once the font resource is properly available, and you shouldn\'t get FOUT-style behaviour (provided the CSS is well written," of course)""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Remember: we\\\'re dealing with icons"," so the absolute first question you need to ask is ""which markup am I using"," based on the role this icon plays"". If the icon is eye candy only", then it doesn\\\'t matter in the slightest what the text is, because no one is going to see that text (only the subtituted icon) and screen readers should absolutely not read them out (for instance, a facebook icon next to a link to a facebook article should not exist as far as a screen reader is concerned. It contributes nothing). In this case (and why I requested GSUB rules) it\\\'s a matter of ease-of-maintenance. On the other hand, if your icon is heavily semantic, you need probably need to stop and ask yourself why you\\\'re using an icon at all. If the text matter to readers, why are you removing that text and replacing it with a picture that not everyone is going to be able to easily understand, or make out? This is an important UI question. By asking the right question before using Font-Awesome, but really _any_ icon solution, you won\\\'t run into this problem.

Case 3: using bootstrap at one page together with no bootstrap markup that use same class names.

The biggest hurdle I\'ve found with trying to add or supplement the FA with file type icons from another font is that I haven\'t found one that\'s 14px-based. Trying to add the Font Awesome icons, or a selection of them, to a new font with 16px-based file type icons from another font leads to inconsistent alignments in positioning and of course the different optimal sizes create their own issues. Right now my solution is to use FA and additionally load in selected file type icons using Icomoon . It means 2 different fonts to load, 2 different sets of styles, and making sure they are used appropriately to avoid sizing and alignment differences. It\'s a bit of a pain but it can work.

Please see response below:It is OK to distribute fonts licensed under the terms of the SIL OFL 1.1  _alongside_ a GPL licensed work. What we mean by ""alongside"" is that the font andthe program would be considered ""separate works"" under the terms of the GNU GPL",because they aren\\\'t combined in any way, but simply aggregated. It is often the casethat a program (such as a word processor) can make use of makes use of a particularfont without the font being considered part of the Program or the font and programbeing considered a single combined work. It is of course possible that you could create a combined work depending on howimplementation is done. Such cases should be avoided with works licensed under theGNU GPL," because the SIL OFL 1.1 is incompatible with the GNU GPL. This is becauseSection 5 of SIL OFL 1.1 has the following requirement that is incompatible with theterms of the GNU GPL: ""The Font Software", modified or unmodified, in part or inwhole, must be distributed entirely under this license," and must not be distributedunder any other license."" This is incompatible with the terms of the GNU GPL",because the GNU GPL has a similar statement that requires the entire work to beunder the terms of the GNU GPL.I hope that helps.

The idea is then to decline the database icon fa-database in a whole set: add-database, remove-database, database-warning, database-error, refresh-database, download-database, etc... Or maybe another approach, if it\\\'s not possible to stack groups of icons and groups of stacked icons, add a css style in order to create a surrounding on an icon (which will fill by the way the inner part of the icon), something like:""fa fa-plus-circle text-success fa-surround fa-surround-inverse fa-stack-bottom-right""which then would be used in the current stacked, extended with the positioning to be defined.The example would produce something like a green plus-circle surrounded (fa-surround) with black (fa-surround-inverse).

I do some testing and present my results then. I think this issue is getting offtopic. If you want some things added to fontawesome-actions you could use the issue tracker of my repository.

There could be two sections:1. Choose the main icons that should be included (all of them or the most popular ones by default).  Also,  complete categories is possible.2. Add custom stacked icons.  For each one: Choose from a dropdown your main icon Choose from a dropdown the overlay icon, where the most common ones are at the top (e.g. plus, minus, settings, etc) Select the glyphs to be added (Compound  separate for individual coloring) Preview the stacked icons right there Here\\\'s a [quick mockup]url  I made (most functionality is missing, but you get the idea). Additionally," this ""customizer"" could **collect data** on what\\\'s being downloaded", so the most used icons and stacked icon combinations are identified. From this data, the most popular icon stackings could be replaced, if needed, by **manually edited ones** (for example, suppose the user-config stacked icon becomes very popular and it could use some of the artist\\\'s touches, so the server is then instructed to return a custom version instead of the auto-generated one). Edit: Forgot to mention that the ones that _are_ auto-generated, can be done in back-end (and then cached) by @nyon\\\'s excellent algorithms.\'',,,,,,,

Indeed, even if in most of the common use cases, the icons look OK, in some particular cases, the stacking requires some additional adjustments for the final icon to be perfectly fine (post process manual modifications, etc...). In your proposal, since you take the whole set of icons, to be combined with, again, the whole set of icons, the rendered icon could be problematic with some combinations. For that matter, I am pretty sure the team want to avoid a series of request from the users for icons not initially intented to be combined together (my personal opinion here again). Unless, using your solution, we can restrict to subset of icons," which we are sure have been tested fine and validated (but that\'s a lot of tests :-) )""'",,,,,,,,
Font-Awesome,1181,open,68,2013-05-26 15:55:00,834.73,,1,,"b'b\' @AlainDsome ideas regarding this:1. When the user chooses an ""untested"" combination", a warning could be shown, indicating that the combination might look bad and to use it under the user\\\'s own risk.2. Along with the warning," there could be ""rating"" buttons where users say ""this looks good"" or ""this needs fixing"".  The collective ratings could then be seen by admins in order to more easily promote combinations as ""tested"" or to spot the most requested combinations that need fixing.3. There could be a filter to ""Show only tested combinations""","Show tested and highly rated combinations"" or ""Show all combinations"".  Perhaps the second one is the default (only the bold and adventurous users dare to use the last one).4. Some icon overlays could have its own custom logic, and even be exclusively overlays.  Some examples: Slashed icons, as mentioned by @tagliala and implemented by @nyon ""Remote"" overlay (little wi-fi-like waves at the corner).  Imagine mixing it with icons like file, play, database, camera, user, phone, print, hdd, headphones, etc. ""Broken"" icons.  I realize that this might be a lot harder to implement, but it could still work with some icons (perhaps intersect a zig-zag line along the vertical axis, slightly rotate the right half).  Might be better with the opaque or outlined icons (e.g. broken heart, folder, envelope, comment, star, square, cloud, file, glass, ...)\''

Font-Awesome,1697,open,body,2013-08-01 13:53:14,00:00,,,1,b'b\' Hello guys. I very appreciate your work, i\\\'m using your icons on , a tv-series management webapp. So, first of all, thank you for your efforts. Now, it would be nice if you add a catapult to your icons. Yes, i know you have plenty of requests, some of which very serious like NFC, SMART-CARD and other boring stuff. But think of how much Font-Awesome would be improved by adding a wonderful Catapult. 1. Catapults are REALLY awesome stuff and you are Font-Awesome, can you really afford to keep going without a catapult in your list?2. Catapults means a lot! They mean you really want to do something," let\\\'s say... like a catapult. Just think about: ""I\\\'m going there LIKE A CATAPULT"""," or ""I\\\'m about to CATAPULT you out of here"""," or ""Ehi"," where\\\'s my CATAPULT?""... did you see? Every day in our life we talk about catapults!3. In our app we need an icon for ""Similar"". Well", there isn\\\'t. Not your fault guys," there\\\'s no icon for ""Similar"" in the whole internet. So what can we do when there\\\'s no icon to mean something? We use a CATAPULT", of course!  So if you could implement something like this:url  That would be absolutely AWESOME.  Thank you guys,see you soon, like a catapult! Stefano\'',,,,,

Font-Awesome,1799,closed,36,2013-08-18 09:18:20,911.9,1,,,"b'b"" @ThomasGreiner Thanks for the clarification. But FWIW", I disagree slightly that ABP is completely neutral on this issue. This blog post:url and this page:url  Contain /descriptions/ of what fanboy-social will do for you. Those descriptions focus on sharing buttons that track you even when you don\'t engage with them. They /don\'t/ make it clear that e.g. social LOGIN buttons will be effected. (yes, whole login buttons disappear: url  I\'d suggest ABP ought to adjust its /descriptions/ of fanboy-social to be more clear. OR, if they\'d rather remain neutral, to stop endorsing it at all. As things stand, I claim that from the perspective of an average ABP user who reads one of those pages, agrees that she doesn\'t like being tracked by Facebook share buttons she doesn\'t engage with, and installs the \'s a BUG that icons and indeed /whole login buttons/ suddenly disappear. I know anecdotally I\'ve had a few users who were confused and frustrated that in some browsers they couldn\'t log in to my website. (I\'ve also emailed the fanboy-social maintainer at @ directly. If people agree this is a bug in fanboy-social, they might consider doing the same.) I don\'t intend to point fingers here. There are probably people who /want/ to block social login buttons, and it makes sense to me for ABP, with some customization, to provide that functionality. I think we just need to tighten up the the messaging so users don\'t get unexpected behavior and these projects don\'t have to play cat and mouse :) IMO the first step there is drawing some distinctions in what /kinds/ of social things you might want to block. My first guess at that is something like (1) only things that track you without you even clicking (2) all share buttons (\'I never want to share so don\'t even ask me\'), but not login buttons (3) anything having anything to do with social," including sharing and logging in.""'",,,,,,,,,,

Font-Awesome,1799,closed,49,2013-08-18 09:18:20,263.6,,1,,"b'b"" @Paulmicha AdBlock currently subscribes users to four filter lists by default: EasyList", the primary list of ad-blocking filters that all ad blockers use; AdBlock Custom, which cleans up a few troublesome filters from EasyList and other filters that break specific sites, and adds blocks for ad providers EasyList doesn\'t care about; Acceptable Ads, which blocks intrusive, annoying ads while allowing ads that promise to be good (how faithfully some ads adhere to the AA guidelines is up for debate); and the Adblock Warning Removal list, which prevents you from seeing warnings to disable your ad blocker on some sites. We also include some lists that are available by selection but are not enabled by default. Among them is Fanboy\'s Annoyances, which includes Fanboy\'s Social list. That\'s the one that\'s causing trouble with Font Awesome\'s social media icons. Finally, users can subscribe to any list they like if they know its URL. All of the above is true for ABP as well, with some slight differences. So you see there really isn\'t any way we can prevent this on the extension side. It\'s a filter list issue, and we don\'t maintain the filter lists. I wish we _could_ help! It would make things easier for our users," which is my chief concern.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, as mentioned in my previous comment, I\\\'d suggest discussing the scope of this particular filter list with the [EasyList]url  team or alternatively reporting individual issues using the issue reporter in Adblock Plus for Firefox. What Adblock Plus does is recommend certain filter lists by providing its users the ability to easily enable popular features.

As an icon", it is commonly seen in places of public accommodation to indicate that events will be given in sign language (sometimes via an interpreter, sometimes directly by a sign language user). There are legal reasons for the difference between the usages, largely that deaf people have fewer legal rights to request interpreter services in most European countries than American deaf people do in the US. The point I\\\'m emphasizing here is that the ASL icon is indeed about interpreting," whereas the European-inspired/""more international"" icon is about the use of sign language in general", not necessarily via an interpreter.

I find it very confusing when **left** and **right** definitions are direction-dependent. For example, standard CSS flipping techniques produce results such as: This is obviously not what the [documentation]url  suggests even if it does help create RTL websites. It assumes too much. In the playground you referred to, for example, the class is actually pointing right. What if the icon desired is, in fact, an arrow pointing left? (Case:  instructions.) That\\\'s why my preference is for classes that convey what the content is supposed to display. If I want a left-pointing arrow, I will use  . If I want an arrow pointing in the writing direction, I\\\'ll use  . And if I want an arrow pointing in the opposite direction, I\\\'ll use (say)  . Modifying the CSS you posted in the playground," this would look like so: And then: RTL support often suffers what I call ""the mirror effect"" which is arbitarily-applied flipping of content and visualizations.

All undo type icons have a curved arrow and because this has a straight arrow", I think most people will not think it is obvious that this means undelete. Even your icon for undo is a circular swoosh of an arrow, so this icon isn\'t consistent with the rest of the icon set that it belongs to. Even if you wanted to stay with the straight arrow, I think the examples given in the first post are much better because the arrow leaves the trash can and gives a clear indication that something is coming out of the trash. Having a straight arrow contained within the trash can does not invoke the notion of something being removed from the trash can for me.

I\\\'d prefer ""fa-football"" myself. Otherwise it\\\'s confusing when trying to search for it. I know that the name ""football"" can mean other sports in a few other countries (eg. in New Zealand", football refers to rugby, and in the USA it\\\'s obviously their name for gridiron). However in the vast majority of countries, football refers to soccer, and personally I think that\\\'s the meaning that everyone would understand, even those who are from countries where it has a different meaning (eg. in NZ it means rugby but we still know that everywhere else it means soccer, so there\\\'s no confusion for us). If not fa-football, then maybe fa-soccer or fa-soccerball? But my vote would be for fa-football, and make fa-futbol an alias. If you ever decide to make an icon for a gridiron ball or rugby ball, you can call those fa-gridiron and fa-rugbyball or whatever. :) Maybe @AlainDshould reopen this until @davegandy can give his definitive answer? ;)\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,

Even in the USA itself, I\'m pretty sure, that they know the difference between football and American football (it sounds a bit weird to them though to repeat American, but they understand) Still I don\'t think that it was a smart choice of reserving football for the American football: 1 country against all the other ones.

Why does ""football"" have to be reserved for American football though? If the USA is the only country that uses this word to refer to American football", and the word is almost universally used to refer to soccer everywhere else, then surely it would make more sense to use football to refer to the soccer ball icon I would propose using fa-gridiron for American football that\\\'s an accurate name that removes any ambiguity over which sport it refers to. Everyone knows what gridiron is. Then use fa-football for the soccer ball (and fa-futbol can be an alias). However, if you absolutely must use fa-football for the American football, then personally I would _not_ prefer fa-football-soccer for the soccer ball it\\\'s too long, and it\\\'s redundant (football = soccer, so we don\\\'t need both terms in the same name).

In the future, we\'ll sadly need to name these from a single country perspective. Since we understand more of the cultural context for the US, we\'ll have to go from that point of view.

Font-Awesome,4296,open,10,2014-09-03 01:12:57,1015.62,,1,,"b'b"" @tagliala On browsers rendering with DirectWrite", the default behavior is to allow full subpixel precision rendering of a font at sizes of 21px or greater. And the icons in the font set look _fine_ at those sizes, if occasionally somewhat blurred. This has very little to do with rendering at exact multiples of 14px. (Which is a big WTF, btw.) The problem is that at pixel sizes below 21px, browsers apply the hinting embedded in the font, which in FontAwesome 4.2 and up is just utterly, utterly broken. This problem is **not limited to brand icons**. It affects all the icons in the set, but is just more noticible on icons with intricate detail (like most brand icons...) than on others. You can, infact, work around the poor rendering fidelity due to the broken hinting by setting a css rotation small enough to remain visually undetectable, but large enough to force the affected browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome) to start rendering fonts with full sub-pixel geometric precision. Here\'s a snap of the **unfixed** icon in the searchbox on FontAwesome\'s own icon overview page, as seen in Firefox on Windows 7 with Direct2D and DirectWrite enabled:![Unfixed]url  And here\'s the same," with a added to the class via the developer tools:![Fixed]url  Notice the difference there?""'",,,,,,,,,

Font-Awesome,4296,open,12,2014-09-03 01:12:57,173.87,,1,,"b'b"" Generally speaking", you need hinting set up properly to get a font to render at subpixel position in Windows. If hinting is not present, then as far as I know both DirectWrite and GDI ClearType will default to snapping towards the nearest whole pixel. This is what FontAwesome 4.2+ is currently doing, I believe. Browsers rendering with DirectWrite have a hardcoded behavior to skip hinting tables altogether and render at full subpixel precision for font-sizes greater than 20 pixels. The rotation hack forces them to do the same with font-sizes of 20 pixels or smaller. However, that does not fix the issue for browsers stuck with GDI ClearType, which iirc does not have the same behavior of starting to render at full subpixel precision. I don\'t think there\'s a way around it: you _must_ have proper hinting tables to fix this completely.The good news is that having TTFAutoHint generate hinting works OK for most icons," atleast given a cursory glance.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Font-Awesome,4296,open,24,2014-09-03 01:12:57,185.07,,1,,"b'b"" The Quartz rendering engine ignores hinting information baked into fonts and does its own thing. The fact that a font works OK on Macs means absolutely nothing. Infact", I\'d go sofar as to say that the fact that many type designers never bothered inspecting their work outside of the safe little cushioned isle of their Macs, is one of the leading causes for the absymal state of cross-platform rendering fidelity for many fonts currently available for use on the web.Windows 10 changed the rendering rules for DirectWrite, iirc.That may include Microsoft having switched to a similar approach as Apple: ignore hinting always, always rendering at full precision and do the subpixel handling yourself.That would probably be becaus in a basic Windows VM installation DirectWrite is _disabled_ due to lack of hardware support. Firefox then falls back to GDI rendering. The default behavior of GDI rendering in Windows applications is to adher to the OS setting for ClearType. And in most VM installs it will be _turned off_ by default. Hence all the jagged edges in Firefox on both the icon font and the normal text. IE though, while it will also not have DirectWrite, will by default override the OS level setting for ClearType and will render with ClearType _enabled_, so in IE\'s case the normal text will be ok, and only the icon font will be jaggy because the icon font is not properly hinted. (Sidenote: hinting is actually much more important for GDI rendering than it is for DirectWrite rendering.) Chrome will, when DirectWrite is not available, fall back to its own internal font renderer which, if I remember correctly, will render with full geometric precision when no hinting (or broken hinting," or an unapplicable type of hinting) is present. So.. I guess you just delivered the evidence you were looking for that proves the hinting is broken?""'",,,,,,,,,,

Font-Awesome,5007,closed,10,2014-11-19 09:33:06,1380.88,1,,,"b'b"" Figures... FYI; This is a long-standing issue with Webkit in general. Webkit doesn\'t obey instructions that go below some semi-arbitrary hardcoded set of lower limits", which are picked based on the browser\'s configured default script. For western script this limit lies at 3 or 4 pixels, while for most eastern asian scripts the lower limit lies at 10 to 12 pixels. Iirc, this was put into Webkit in a gravely misguided effort to preserve text legibility, which would explain why the asian scripts have an increased lower limit; increased glyph complexity requires a bigger minimum size to remain readable. (It sure doesn\'t explain the odd-ball 3px minimum for western script though. Even if you squint and have your eyes parked inches from your screen," you still won\'t be able to tell what\'s written in such a small size...) This is also the root-cause of why the trick to align inline block elements doesn\'t work out of the box in Webkit and why it is so often fixed with a magic number of 4 pixel negative letter-spacing or word-spacing.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For instance, I have the following in my application: i { font-size: 22px; } which gets invalidated by the initial .fa code since they have the same CSS specificity, and the FontAwesome SASS is included at the top of the file. To overcome this, I have to change it to: .fa {  font-family: FontAwesome;} which allows me to set the custom font size without using the !important symbol.

This will not break backward compatibility and will allow to customize the base font size,  **given that** fa-2x, fa-3x will be related to container\\\'s font size and not base icon font size.

""You want to change base icon size one for good"," am I right?""No", that is not what we\\\'re doing.  We don\\\'t want to set a base font size in FontAwesome for our entire project, we want to specify a font size for individual icons on a case-by-case basis.  As an example, here\\\'s what we\\\'re doing," which has worked for many previous versions of FontAwesome: (I replaced ""<"" with ""["" because GitHub won\\\'t render the HTML otherwise) HTML:[button class=""select"" onclick=""...""]  [i class=""fa fa-icon-glass""][/i][/button] CSS:button {  &.select {        &.fa-icon-glass {      &:before {        font-size: 18px;      }    }    }  }} With the addition of the following line in v4.2", the custom font size specification as shown above no longer works: .fa {  font: normal normal normal 14px/1 FontAwesome; // shortening font declaration  font-size: inherit; // can\\\'t have font-size inherit on line above, so need to override} The effect of this is that the previously working CSS commands shown above are ineffective, and all of the FontAwesome icons remain the same size, breaking backwards compatibility. The reason that this causes problems is," that since you included the font size inside a single-line ""font"" command"," you have to issue a new ""font"" command in order to override it"," which means that everyone who upgrades to 4.2 has to inspect thousands of lines of SASS code and change all of the ""font-size"" commands to ""font"" commands", which is very time consuming, and highly redundant (since FontAwesome needs to be specified over and over). I suggest changing it back to the v4.1 version," which has the same effect of setting FontAwesome as the default font without hard-coding a font size into the ""font"" command.  It\\\'s not helpful to anyone that you\\\'re setting the base font size to 14px or any other size.  This should be determined by the natural CSS inheritance flow of the page", not by a special FontAwesome variable. .fa {font-family: FontAwesome;// *\\\\* delete the font-size: inherit command, it\\\'s unnecessary} Does that explain our issue better?\'',,,,,

So, the only classes that should exist on the [i] element are the ones related to font-awesome," which are ""fa fa-history"" (fa-44px was included for demonstration).  In order to override the global font command that you added in 4.2"," it becomes necessary to add another class to the [i] since the ""body div What we\\\'re actually doing", which worked with 4.1 and below," is setting a custom font size on each [i] element in our application using the ""font-size"" command"," which can be different sizes according to its use on the page.  Because you\\\'re including this condensed ""font"" command with a hard-coded 14px"," along with a redundant ""font-size: inherit"" command (it\\\'s already inherited!)"," it forces us to add a class to the [i] in order to compete with the specificity of the "".fa"" command. The actual issue is that you haven\\\'t improved anything in 4.2 by using this condensed font command (except that it looks cool)", you\\\'ve only made it difficult to override the font-size.  If you look back to 4.1 (and below)," the font command does not include a ""font-size"" command"," which allows the user to set their own font size without competing with the global "".fa"" command. Here\\\'s the change again: 4.2:.fa {  font: normal normal normal 14px/1 FontAwesome; // shortening font declaration  font-size: inherit; // can\\\'t have font-size inherit on line above", so need to override} replace with: 4.1:.fa {  font-family: FontAwesome;  font-style: normal;  font-weight: normal;} TLDR: Font Awesome shouldn\\\'t be setting a base font-size at all.  That should be left up to the web page, the web browsers settings, and the user\\\'s stylesheets.  Your condensed font command," along with the ""font-size: inherit;"" command"," causes specificity problems with user\\\'s stylesheets that have to compete with your ""14px"" and ""inherit"" font size commands.  Remove the font-size commands from the "".fa"" section and all is well again (meaning that we can actually upgrade to 4.2 without breaking our application).\''",,,,,

The CSS trick actually already has a small margin we can use for similar situations but I think the problem might be in the sub pixel scale so while removing 1px on the letter-spacing from 10px to 9px helps it doesn\'t fully correct the effect. It would be awesome if you guys could redesign them to give more freedom to recombine icons. Regarding [fa-check-square-o]url  there isn\'t much to do and while I don\'t care much about it at the moment if the width delta to the others was a natural number it would be easy to hide by adjusting the letter-spacing.

Currently we are developing a new web-based controlling and e-portal solution", in which third party applications (all kinds of desktop and web applications) also can be implemented. Since our Development Team suggested FontAwesome as best practice for this new software, we went for it. To implement  (our web-based workflow for accounts payable automation) we need the brand icon in the font awesome framework.  Although just in German language, further information about Soreco AG is provided on , and for more details about  on -.

Font-Awesome,12249,closed,body,2018-02-05 06:46:01,00:00,,,1,"b'b"" Hi",  I have watched FA5 grow and evolve into the stunning icon library that it now is, but until now I haven\'t had a chance to use it for any projects (long and boring reasons). That being said, I have noticed that the NPM implementation doesn\'t work the way the documentation says it should. I have messed around with it for a while now and am pretty sure the implementation has changed without the docs being updated.  So here goes nothing... as per the docs we are expected to use something like the below.   This is all good and well but the method only accepts an array of icons which is the implementation I\'ve used below.   My way works perfectly and I\'ll explain why. Using the documented method yields only one icon for use, from what I\'ve seen while debugging the compiled code any new icon overwrites the last one in an endless cycle which isn\'t fun.  As mentioned, I\'ve been testing this for quite a while now and am pretty sure it\'s a simple disconnect between the NPM package and the documentation. For reference, I\'m using the below packages which are all up-to-date.   Hopefully, it\'s just a minor thing as FA5 is beautiful," elegant and extremely simple to integrate.

What I found is when the hook runs, it automatically calls upon the function which attempts to inject the SVG into the DOM. The injection functionality is working but what happens is this.  1. The core library is completely loaded when the page load which means all elements are available for it to find and use 2. I add an icon to the library which runs again 3. I add another icon, but because the first addition runs  ," the DOM element is no longer available for the library to use  I believe this is a basic oversight and that DOM elements without a matching library definition shouldn\'t be manipulated in any way.

Both the Hewbrew and the Arabic language are right-to-left languages so the book front cover usually is on the ""back"".

Regarding fa-torah : I see the thought process there (it was switched to a scroll", and it was made Jewish with a star of David), but as current it is not a Torah scroll. All Torah scrolls are opened horizontally, and, being as they contain a considerable amount of text, most of the scroll will always be wrapped around 2 wooden poles.

In addition most glyphs of FontAwesome Pro cannot be selected! They don\'t appear at all.  ### What did you expect? No problems at all and reaching all glyphs Using TTF is essential because OTF fonts cannot be embedded in PowerPoint files. Aren\'t TTF fonts tested or only a conversion of OTF fonts. The bugs with TTF seem to are so heavy that usage in our team is not reliable and I have to withdraw the TTF fonts.  We\'ll have to test OTF types first tests show a much better handling but still problems with some import filters which do not transfer all code points from Font Awesome 5 Pro for example (Word import into FrameMaker)  ### What version and implementation are you using? 5.3.1 Pleas find attached a PPTX test file [FA ]url   ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Well for Microsoft systems and products you should use TTF fonts only this is official Microsoft policy.

So I don\\\'t understand your preference of OTF. Ligatures are not a use case for Symbol fonts, or am I wrong?

Font-Awesome,14694,closed,5,2019-02-27 17:00:37,20.68,,,1,"b'b"" Hi", all.  Thanks for the good feedback about the pulse animation and its name. Since it was added in Font Awesome 4, the term pulse has come to be used for a particular type of animation (mostly dealing with opacity or slightly scaling things up). I\'ll bring this feedback to the team for future animations included with Font Awesome thoughts. If you have other icon animations you\'d like to have right out of the box, feel free to share those too.  In the meantime," that missing icon in our [Animating Icons]url  docs should be fixed. Thanks for letting us know about that one. \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x84 ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
