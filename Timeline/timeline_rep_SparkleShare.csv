Since Sparkleshare presumes ssh:// in the url (check the ~/ file to see this) my experience would suggest that the only syntax to add a gitolite repo to Sparkleshare is: ssh://user@ ...where repo is your gitolite repo with or without the .git on the end Thus the values you\\\'d put into Sparkleshare ""Add remote folder..."" would be:Address:// user@serverFoldername: reponame (with or without .git on the end) Seems simple stated this way but I was mislead due to other threads I read while working this out that seemed to state you need the full server path to the repo if you are using the ssh:// protocol. This appears not to be the case.

SparkleShare,243,closed,body,2011-06-22 11:33:04,00:00,,,1,b'b\' Hi, I\\\'m experimenting with sparkleshare using my own hosted git repo, using Ubuntu clients:10.04, compiled from current git HEAD11.04 stable 0.2 release All works fine so far in simple tests. Getting more adventurous, I rsync\\\'d an entire directory structure worth of stuff into the sparkleshare folder it\\\'s about a 4Gb directory with a mix of small to very large files (100Mb plus). The sparkleshare console went nuts as it discovered all the files,  but things seems to be going ok. But, it stopped after completing the git \\\'add\\\' operation," but never went ahead to a commit.  I\\\'m not in the office any more but will post a log tomorrow. A ""git status"" in the directory shows a bunch of staged (added) files", but no matter how long I wait, the sparkleshare daemon doesn\\\'t go ahead with a commit. I stopped it, did some git cleanup, then restarted: $ sparkleshare stop$ cd $ git reset hard HEAD$ git clean -f -d$ sparkleshare start and it\\\'s fine again, for onesy-twosy file adds.  But, if I repeat the same experiment, it fails in the same way again. Related to this is another pseudo-bug if sparkleshare dies after the git add, but before the commit, it doesn\\\'t seem to detect that case when next it starts.  so, you get left with a bunch of staged but uncommitted files. I could write a script to tricklefeed into the sparkleshare directory, but i\\\'d rather not, and it seems that a big initial dump like this is probably a pretty common thing for initial setups? Any suggestions on how to debug this (other than giving logs as I will do tomorrow)? Thanks for a great app, given the epic authentication fail on DropBox yesterday I would expect to see a flood of users coming your way! Thanks, John\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SparkleShare,243,closed,2,2011-06-22 11:33:04,542.63,,1,,b'b\' First, here\\\'s a little script I wrote to generate some pseudo random directory structure and files.  Gives git a terrible time as the file contents are from /, so there\\\'s no nice hashing opportunities, but anyway: gah github markdown won\\\'t let me paste a bash script in between pre tags. Or rather, it\\\'s broken the format completely.  Will see if I can attach it or similar. Anyway, once I get it to you, run it like this: $ mkdir foo$ ./genfoo 10 to generate 10 levels of depth etc Then, rsync the resulting foo directory into a sparkleshare directory $ rsync -a foo/ ~// I did this once, with a small directory, and it works fine, the git  sequence went through no problems. So, I generated a new junk tree, rsync\\\'d it in over the top, and here\\\'s the sparkleshare log:  10:47:19 [Event][PetaLogix] Renamed \\\'file3\\\'10:47:19 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:19 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:19 [Event][PetaLogix] Renamed \\\'file7\\\'10:47:19 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'/\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'/\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'/\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found, checking if settled.10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changed \\\'/\\\'10:47:20 [Event][PetaLogix] Changes found," checking if settled.10:47:20 [Local][PetaLogix] Changes have settled.10:47:20 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:47:20 [SyncUp][PetaLogix] Initiated10:47:20 [Cmd] / add all10:49:01 [Git][PetaLogix] Changes staged10:49:01 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:49:34 [Cmd] / status porcelain10:49:48 [Cmd] / commit -m ""+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir0/file0\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir1/file0\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir1/file1\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir1/file2\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir1/file3\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir1/file4\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file0\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file1\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file2\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file3\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file4\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file5\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file6\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file7\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file8\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir2/file9\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir3/file0\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir3/file1\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir3/file2\\xe2\\x80\\x99+ \\xe2\\x80\\x98dir0/dir0/dir0/dir3/file3\\xe2\\x80\\x99...""

SparkleShare,326,closed,body,2011-09-04 16:52:11,00:00,1,,,b'b\' By the nature of git, empty folders are not versionized. Therefore it\\\'s a task for sparkleshare to force versioning of empty folders since the end user should not deal with the behavior of git, but just using a normal folder as you would do in a normal file system. Therefore, sparkleshare should check whether a folder is empty and add a hidden file, i.e.  , to get it versionized by git. This issue applies to two cases:1.  A user creates a new folder (without any file)2.  All files of a folder are deleted For the first case, sparkleshare does nothing because there is no change for git. The second case has a more important impact since a user would not expect a folder to be deleted when he removes all files in it (if he wants to add other files for example). Therefore, sparkleshare need to do two things:If a folder is empty, add a hidden file to itIf a folder is not empty anymore (The second action is not really needed," its just what im thinking about not to confuse the end user (""what is _that_ file suppose to mean?"").\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SparkleShare,335,closed,3,2011-09-10 19:13:57,244.4,1,,,"b'b"" Obviously", I am not very interested in the 2 levels of revision control, but on the sync. Scenario: I work at 2 different offices in each having a desktop. Furthermore I have one laptop I usually work on and another laptop that I only use at conferences or on vacation, since it is very light but not powerful enough to do anything serious on it. Whatever machine I am on, I want to have all my most recent stuff to work on. I cannot rely on a disk exported via internet, since the laptop can often be disconnected. Using git alone for this does not help. If one day you work on a machine on 5 different projects, you need to remember to push all of them before changing machine. Additionally, if some file in some working tree remains uncommited or unstashed it will not propagate. Currently I use unison. I have an active documents folder that I sync to one of the desktops that is always online and that acts as a central repo. Each project managed by git that is in the active document folder gets synced with both its worktree and the history. Git does not complain for this \'abuse\'. So far so good.  However, everytime I start working on a different machine and (most important) every time I am ready to leave it I need to remember invoking unison. Since every now and then I forget, this can be a pain.  Having an automatic synchronization (a la dropbox or wuala) would probably be an improvement. Unfortunately, sparkleshare cannot (still) be used for the task. Truly, using it would give you two levels of revision control, but that would not be expensive. Provided that you do not repack (too often) in the git repos on the clients, what would end up in the sparkleshare git repo are objects that do not change (a git object can only appear not mutate), so you really do not waste space. And actually, the double level of revision control can even be useful. In my current scenario (based on unison) if a hard disk breaks down and starts corrupting data, the corrupted data propagates. Unless I can see the problem before all the machines have received the corrupted data, I can experience data loss. With the double level of revision control, I can be safer on this side," particularly if I put the sparkleshare git repo on RAID1. ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How would I deal with projects that have many different branches so that each branch gets pushed to a corresponding branch on the other side? If there is some workflow that I am currently overlooking, I would be interested in knowing more about it. wrt the rest of the doc: Wrapping a whole source control repository in another repository is not ideal.There was a time when having nested directories was considered not ideal :-)Apart from this, the only thing that looks critical to me (at least with the git backend) is pack files, that might easily get too big for git, but as you mention the issue is not different from what one might encounter with large PDFs, ZIP files (or any format based on that, such as openoffice, docx, jar files), large  archives, etc.  Note that this includes almost all recent document formats for productivity suites.This is why I advocate that sparkleshare is given the ability to apply transformations on the files on the fly as they are trasfered to and from the server:1) To avoid problems with  that are named in such a way that some specific backend does not like (e.g. .git) or to work around some specific backend peculiarities (e.g. git does not store empty dirs).2) To split too big files in smaller chunks. One option is using a rolling checksum mechanism a la bup, but note that for some file types, recognizing and exploding them (as pristine-tar can do) could be a superior choice.IMHO, all this is quite important for two reasons:1) One wants to hide the peculiarities of the backend. There is an obvious advantage if the user does not need to know if sparkleshare is using a git, mercurial, unison or sftp backend and does not need to modify  behavior accordingly2) One wants to manage any file and particularly large ones.

On the other hand, if Sparkleshare needs to rename files before a commit, and rename them back afterwards, things get complicated soon. It would be very awkward to update manually. Also, because it is more complicated, more things can go wrong if you do try it. And from the technical point of view, I don\'t know if it is an good idea to have a git repo inside another git repo. The .git directory contains a kind of database, which is kept consistent with the git executable. I don\'t know any internals of git, but it would be difficult to automatically handle a merge conflict. But of course if you never update simultaneously at two clients, there should not be any problem. Users who use git, will probably understand that. To summarize, I do see advantages of syncing git repo\'s inside a SparkleShare folder," but I am afraid if things get too complicated. At least when you use git as backend.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SparkleShare,437,closed,9,2011-11-17 03:39:03,745.93,1,,,"b'b"" This is going to be a huge problem. Git basically looks at the entire history for most of it\'s operations", and doing a repack on a repo with several gigabytes can easily hog all of your cpu und your memory. I crashed servers doing git repack or git gc. Why is the history even stored on the client? Why not just download the latest version? I tried sparkleshare yesterday, i have a 5GB repo full of ~100-200MB files. SparkleShare on Mac hung regularly and after the initial upload the repo had over 10GB even though the files along are just 5. This is unacceptable. I think using git on the client-side is a design-flaw. It would make more sense to use rsync or something to copy the repo and use git on the server to store the history, kind of like DropBox does it with svn (as far as i know). There are options for git to just clone a certain depth," maybe you can look into that.

Update:Watchdog does intercept edits from TextMate or Sublime Text. I\'ll check their source code. Update2:Libraries that use FSEvent such as rb-fsevent for Ruby don\'t exhibit this problem. How is SparkleShare doing this? Or can you give me a pointer where to look in the source code? ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Apple suggest more to implement two different entries with opposite states or a checkbox. Microsoft prefers to put the choices in submenus like:  NotificationsIn general all the big company guidelines aren\'t really clear what to do in this special case. It\'s more about what does the user expect whether he sees an **action** or a **state**?! Currently Sparkleshare sees it as an action. Nevertheless"," in the end it changes a state (). If the user expects a state but Sparleshare \'only\' offers an \'action\' the user is confused where to find the current state. So he presses the action and reenters the menu a second time to be sure that the action changed to the opposite. Than he rethinks which state may cause the currently shown _action_.

""[X] Show Notifications"" for GNOME and Windows"," and ""Turn Notifications "" on Mac.

SparkleShare,640,closed,6,2012-03-16 03:38:58,140.45,,,1,"b'b"" I think it\'s just a bit tricky with these **** items within menus.  You are right", it may be the best way to follow the guidelines individually. However it might be possible that you use the \'_checkmark solution_\' for all the OSs. The last sentence in the [Toggled Menu Items]url  section seams to be more a warning than an advice.**Don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t use a checkmark when the toggled item indicates the presence or absence of a feature** In such a case, users can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be sure whether the checkmark means that the feature is currently in effect or that choosing the command turns the feature on.* That\'s exactly the problem when checkmarks (states) are used together with an \'action phrase\'. I guess, they mean, if you want to use a checkmark then it might be good just to use it together with one subject like in **[x] Notifications** instead of **[x] Show Notifications** because the latter mixes up the current _state_ with an _action_. Presumably they want to push the designer more in the direction of their previous paragraph:**Use a checkmark when the toggled items represents an attribute that is currently in effect.** It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy for users to scan for checkmarks in a list of attributes to find the ones that are in effect. For example, in the Mail Format menu," users can see at a glance which styles have been applied to the selected text. IMHO if you reduce it to **[x] Notifications** in all three OSs that should be ok. I probably would summarize it as: \'_Never use verbs (actions) together with checkmarked items (states)_\'.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Setting custom project paths requires adding the to the config file.  Getting this right the first time was a frustrating experience of trial and error, not knowing what the correct path format was, starting and stopping sparkleshare, copying and deleting files etc. Setting the default sparkleshare parent folder seemingly requires  but I have never gotten this to work. Additionally, the wiki info is very sparse, and their seems to be conflicting info in the issues section.  Changing paths is really critical for many people. It seems fairly high priority toa) Edit the wiki page about changing paths so that it shows how to change the path of the Parent sparkleshare folder, as well as custom paths per project.  Also clarifying proper path formats would really help a lot of people I believe, given that it varies across systems, especially windows.  Also, the names of the example projects are kind of confusing given the context.  Additionally, note if there are any old configuration options that no longer exist as a proper setting or how the different versions of sparkle share differed?  I get the impression that some of these configuration options are no longer even available?  b) If possible, Have a GUI setting for the default Sparkleshare parent folder path.  Also, having an optional setting to set a custom path for the new project would be very helpful, and save time when creating sparkleshare projects in custom locations. Additionally, when a sparkleshare project is ," it seems like sparkle share completely forgets about its existence.  Maybe have sparkle share ask ""Did you  your project?

SparkleShare,1004,closed,body,2012-10-06 13:42:02,00:00,,1,,b'b\' Hi, this seems like a great project, but it isn\\\'t very easy to deploy, even with the dazzle script. Here are some of the problems using it on a raspberry pi:1. The script clearly needs root access," but it doesn\\\'t say anything about that on your page or when you run the script. You at least need to add ""sudo""s around everywhere. 2. There\\\'s this syntax error:  pi@raspberrypi ~ $ dazzle setup (1/4) Creating account ""storage""... /: line 25: [: =: unary operator expected  useradd: Permission denied. useradd: cannot lock /; try again later.3. It doesn\\\'t detect errors at all"," and will happily breeze through permission denied\\\'s and tell you (erroneously) that everything is ok. E.g. you have to look quite hard for the error below I certainly didn\\\'t notice it!  pi@raspberrypi ~ $ dazzle link Paste the contents of ""~/ Name\\\'s link "" (found on the client) into the field below and press .  Link code: ssh-rsa   AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAlgh;wodfguhn;oihoehrkrtjh9ehgjhdkfjghGbrPinEQIIsgk3FSb5B8plEHjBrfAe96Kv5+PZcj+cfbo4QGe3p0uhRh++Im7qmBvb24+wZQfC8DsqBCIQQrhbbMElKoCS2T7xPybptsYTRn8zHHrlbIO2xjhHV89qr1yqOUC83PaNAhXlq5aM+Yft8ZEsyaDeuV+q9tvEBjOJsYtVQ0plFWxAb4RQ== Lappy /: line 137: /: Permission denied  The client with this link code can now access projects.  <Totally untrue! Repeat this step to link more clients.4. You\\\'re distributing a shell script! I mean they\\\'re fine for one-off things", but distributing them to others is pretty much a terrible idea and will _always_ result in stupid errors, like not working in paths with spaces, and [ expecting a unary operator. I really really recommend you use a python script instead! I had a look at dazzle and it wasn\\\'t too long so I made a python version for you to use instead. See below.5. The script creates a user with no password," which apparently makes it ""locked"" and prevents ssh from letting you log in"," even with public key authentication. I added a password to the ""storage"" user and then it worked. Ok here is the script. I tested it a bit but not extensively. It _should_ work with project names with spaces", assuming git is also ok with that, which I somewhat doubt. I haven\\\'t fixed the issue with locked accounts and there are some other TODOs.  \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SparkleShare,1004,closed,1,2012-10-06 13:42:02,168.23,,,1,b'b\' hi! thanks taking the time to point out these issues. it would be great to have an easy setup on the Raspberry Pi.i went ahead and integrated some of your improvements into the Dazzle script. i don\\\'t see a huge benefit of switching over to python however. i\\\'ve chosen to use a bash script to keep things simple and readable, and to make it easy for sysadmins to see what\\\'s going on with their server. another reason was that the initial setup tutorial was simply a straightforward steps of commands. now to address your issues raised: 1 and 3: these seems to be the same issue: not running as root screws things up. i\\\'ve added a check for the root user in the script now. Debian doesn\\\'t come with sudo enabled by default, so we can\\\'t use that. the script assumes a default install of either Debian or Red . you say that the requirement of running as root isn\\\'t documented anywhere. this isn\\\'t true, it\\\'s mentioned both on the home page as in the source repo. this is probably because most of us scan instead of reading every line," so the suggestion to add a root check to the script is definitely a good one. 2: ""/: line 25: [: =: unary operator expected"" i\\\'m not sure why this happens. it doesn\\\'t happen for me on Debian 6. i\\\'ll have to investigate a bit more to fix this but it doesn\\\'t seem like a big problem. 4: """" i disagree here. rewriting it will cause other errors", and as you mention it isn\\\'t complete, so we\\\'ll have to work on it more. it\\\'s not that Dazzle uses any obscure commands or arguments. these commands are quite stable and in any common Linux distro. the python script also calls out to different commands," which will have the same potential problems as a bash script has. 5: ""The script creates a user with no password"," which apparently makes it ""locked"""" i haven\\\'t seen this problem before. i also don\\\'t know what kind of distro your Raspberry Pi uses", but i want to make this work, so we can look into this.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SparkleShare,1004,closed,3,2012-10-06 13:42:02,71.58,,1,,b'b\' No problem, sorry if I seemed strident by the way! Let\\\'s face it, nobody is totally happy to submit bug reports! After using the mac client for a big, it seems really good," so I am quite keen to make this project as easy to use as possible. 1/3. Yeah I guess I could be accused of skimming! (Unless you only just added the ""run the following commands as root"" instructions.) But I\\\'m a firm believer in the principle that software shouldn\\\'t really require instructions (as much as possible)", so at least checking for root is a requirement. Glad you\\\'ve added it! 2. I know what causes this bug and how to fix it, but I\\\'m not actually going to tell you because I want you to _strongly_ reconsider your choice of bash, and I want you to experience the joy of bugs caused by bash being a big hack. You\\\'re right about it being extra work to finish the python. But it will only take me half an hour or so, and I am willing to do it if you promise you\\\'ll use the script instead. Here are my thoughts on why it is such a bad idea to use bash.1. Your script isn\\\'t designed to be read. I agree that in some cases, like when you are explaining how to do a sysadmin task, people are going to read the script to understand it, and then probably run the commands themselves. In that case a bash script is simple and good. But when you have something with functions," that 99% of users aren\\\'t going to read. In that case it should be robust rather than simple. If this isn\\\'t your intention you should get rid of all the ""dazzle setup"" type commands and just list the ""adduser storage"" type stuff on the home page. I don\\\'t think that\\\'s a good idea though.2. Bash can\\\'t handle paths containing spaces. A well-known and well-ignored problem. Sure you _can_ just about manage it", with an array of multilayered quoting methods, but you WILL get it wrong at some point. Bash just is fundamentally incompatible with spaces because it uses them to separate items in lists.3. In python it is true that I had to call () more than I would like! But it has two HUGE advantages over bash: first, it works perfectly with spaces, since the arguments are given in a true non-space-delimited list, and second, it throws an error if the command fails, rather than blindly continuing. Again you _can_ do this in bash, but it isn\\\'t pretty and nobody really does it.4. Bash in general is very error prone and generally crazy. Have you _seen_ how [ is implemented? I will check into the locked user issue a bit more if you like. And let me know if you want to use my (finished!) !\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Bash is not a robust language, no matter how you look at it. It is a shame that you are sticking with a sub-par solution. Do you check if a PubkeyAuth setting already exists? It would be a silly bug to add it again, and sshd may freak out in that case. I found the reason why it isn\\\'t working so you should probably remove this addition," and just search for ""PubkeyAuth no"" instead and print a warning", since it is enabled by default. The reason is: useradd by default uses ! in the password field in /, which means the account is locked, but you can do useradd .... password \\\\* which sets it to *, and then the account isn\\\'t locked, but there is still no valid password.

SparkleShare,1037,closed,52,2012-10-28 17:11:05,484.95,,,1,b'b\' Hello together," to add something to the discussion... I had the problem that on Win7 64-bit the process to add a new hosted project just hang in the first step. The .tmp-folder did not ""grow"" or something", so I suggested a problem before actually getting on the server. Trying to connect via ssh resulted in being asked for my password, so I believed there had not been a key transfer yet. When adding the project via the SparkleShare GUI I hoped that I would perhaps be asked for a user password," but in the forums and wiki here I found hints how this worked on Unix-based systems. So I tried the following with the original installation of SparkleShare.Open a terminal on your windows client and navigate to C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\SparkleShare\\\\msysgit\\\\bin  cd ""C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\SparkleShare\\\\msysgit\\\\bin""Generate a new keypair with name id_rsa and now password  ssh-keygen -t rsa  answer the question for the name of the keypair with ""id_rsa"" and set no password for the key  The key and public key will be saved in ""C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\SparkleShare\\\\msysgit\\\\bin""Copy the public key via SCP to your server and save it here:  ""~/""  I used WinSCP for this", because the shell command in msysgit\\\\bin did not work," perhaps just wrong syntaxLog in via SSH on your Server and copy the public key to the authorized_keys:  cat id_ >  Logout and do the following on your windows clientNavigate to ""C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\SparkleShare\\\\"" and copy your private key there  cd C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\SparkleShare\\\\  copy ..\\\\bin\\\\id_rsa . After that I could login to the server without using my password"," so I suggested this would be enough. But because SparkleShare generated a keypair named by a timestamp in the folder ""%appdata%\\\\sparkleshare"" on my windows client I suggested it uses this pair for authenticating and this did not work. So I moved the files to a backup folder", copied my id_ and id_rsa to this destination and restarted SparkleShare. This worked!Perhaps someone can try this, too. I hope my post helped some of you.

SparkleShare,1106,closed,body,2012-12-12 19:28:05,00:00,,1,,b'b\' I have recurring problems with conflicts. The problem seems similar to #87 and #721, although no case change was involved. I\\\'m using SparkleShare 1.0 with encryption with two users. Both are in Windows. One user creates a new empty text file in the shared folder and immediately renames it (to a completely different name). This causes the original file creation and the rename to be recorded in history.  The other user then gets a notification that there was a conflict and supposedly copies of all conflicting files were created. When the second user looks into his shared folder, only the original file (with the name when it was first created) is located there. No copies.  After that," user 2 gets no more updates from the repository and a new ""conflict happened"" warning pops up every few seconds. I\\\'m suspecting this has something to do with the files being empty. This is a part of my log from when the problem happened:  You can see that SparkleShare assumed that conflicts had been resolved multiple times. During that time", no files were changed, so all the conflicts seem to stem from the same rename at the beginning.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SparkleShare,1118,closed,body,2012-12-19 19:26:56,00:00,1,,,b'b\' Hi,I\\\'m working on a prototype which has a non-git backend, and found a couple of things in  which seem to be incorrect. These are: 1) In the StartFetcher method at approx line 553, it looks for ssh+ and strips out the custom piece. That means that there is no longer a way to tell that this is a custom backend after this point, and everything reverts to being git. It looks like these lines are unnecessary," so in my version I comment the two lines out.// DJB This messes up the definitions of backend later on. try commenting out./*    if ( (""ssh+""))      address = ""ssh"" +  ( (""://""));*/ 2) At approx line 680 in the FinishFetcher method", the argument to  is incorrect. instead of being string backend =  ();shouldn\\\'t it be:string backend =  (());The existing version clearly wrong. My changed version relies on commenting out the code in 1) above. Of course this might not be the  way to fix it, but I\\\'m pretty sure it isn\\\'t right as it currently is, and these changes seem to fix things without breaking anything else. rgdsDave\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In order to do this," I have to use the ssh+unison string. I\'ve added some debug information and found out that the GetBackend method in the SparkleFetcherBase will be called twice. Once with the ssh+unison. This is fine and the initial fetching starts. On completion it seems that it will be rewritten by the if statement from line 111/112 (SparkleFetcherBase). After that the GetBackend method is called again with the rewritten ssh:// string. If this happens the if statement starting in line 347 (SparkleFetcherBase) jumps to else and choose the Git backend automatically. Do you have an idea?""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SparkleShare,1716,closed,15,2016-08-18 23:50:34,423.52,,,1,b'b\' @hbons Better than what this issue was originally made to request? I simply do not agree that that is the case.  Git is already very good at handling conflict resolution, and this method completely throws away all of the existing infrastructure (command  tree etc. etc.) that allow one to do side by side diffs of conflicting files," which is much easier to deal with than ""here is one version of the file and here is another"," work out for yourself which parts of each file you want to keep"" in my opinion. @hbons Why are you so sure that it\\\'s just a handful of users? I think you are making that assumption based on the fact that YOU (for reasons that are WAY beyond me) happen to prefer this method of conflict resolution.  I love sparkleshare and I use it to synchronize 4 different repositories", but this issue afflicts me so regularly that I am seriously considering forking or writing a new tool in a language that is familiar to me to do the same thing. I implore you to reconsider your position on this (namely simply accepting a pull request to ALLOW this behavior -I am not even asking you to do the work) because this sort of forking is not the sort of thing that is generally good for a community. It is hard for me to take your stated reason for not wanting to allow this change (that it will increase complexity) seriously, when it literally amounts to adding a preference and a single conditional statement.  EDIT: I\\\'ll even volunteer to completely maintain the relevant part of the code path. How about this: let me do the work to show you how simple this change really will be. I seriously doubt that it will be very complicated.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SparkleShare,1716,closed,16,2016-08-18 23:50:34,14.82,,,1,"b'b""  @hbons I just noticed this comment. It seems that you aren\'t properly understanding the case that is particularly bothersome to me. Sometimes I want to keep changes from BOTH versions of the file. With sparkleshares current behavior", how is one supposed to integrate changes from both versions of the file?  The easiest way to do this that I can think of (again with sparkle shares current behavior) is to use the diff tool to look at the differences, and then MANUALLY copy the portions from the conflicted file that must be kept. The otheralternative (which is what I actually do) is to do a hard git reset to before the git conflict occured, and manually trigger the same conflict that sparkleshare encountered, and then use git to resolve the changes.  Perhaps you aren\'t understanding the following aspect of the requested behavior: I am not asking that sparkleshare prompt the user with the conflict resolution, or really to do anything at all. I am just asking that it cowardly refuse to do anything at all. This is what it will naturally do if we simply refuse to resolve conflicts in the current code path," because it will simply LOOP over that code path until the conflicts are resolved.  As I\'ve stated before all that needs to be done is: [ ] add a preference [ ] add a conditional to check the preference before taking the current conflict resolution code path  ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
