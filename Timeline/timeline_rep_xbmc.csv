IMO the ""should a texture be released"" call should be made by the engine", not the skin.  Reason is simple: we can do it so why should skinners have to? The idea is to track both usage (reference count + a history count + memory use) and roll out textures that aren\\\'t used much (low history count) when their reference count is zero and a suitable delay has taken place.  In addition, memory use tracking allows us to check available memory and roll textures out if needed either immediately or as required.  The first two are the most important.

Wouldnt keeping the same functionality make it a tree of profiles?, i mean, user-profile thing would limit it a little, and keeping same interaction between profiles would make profiles user-ish, which its current status anyway, but with added level of complexity. User and profiles its very organized, but wouldnt it be a little confusing? (specially for new users). Since every other piece of software i know uses only profiles. Also it would be harder to maintain from a user point of view. Different users = different operating system login i think (altho it can be changed using profiles), after all its the only thing which can encrypt the profile i guess?

Currently the user sees the video and decides what PP option to use (that\\\'s just fine). Personally I keep PP off until I play an SD quality video that looks awful, than I switch PP to an option I like. If you can somehow detect HD quality video (I think we do show icon for SD and HD) then you could add an option to turn off PP for HD and that would be more useful.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If I play a video then at 10:55:30 I move the mouse and wheel down", the log (with a few extra logging lines of my own and midly edited) shows: So the OSD appears at 10:55:30 in response to the mousemove, and the SeekBar responds to the wheel down at 10:55:31. however nothing happens until the OSD times out and disappears at 10:55:38. As soon as this happens the SeekBar window is initialised and DVDPlayer does the seek. So it\'s the presence of the OSD dialog that is blocking the SeekBar from doing the seek. The action is getting queued somewhere and only released when the OSD is de-initialised. I can see two fixes for this. One is to find out why the OSD is blocking the SeekBar," and the other is to simply close the OSD before opening the SeekBar. This is of course what I originally suggested. I\'m unwilling to look any further into why the OSD dialog is blocking the SeekBar. It\'s not an area of the code I know and there must be others who know this code well enough to quickly see what the problem is.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xbmc,689,closed,body,2012-02-13 13:54:50,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" If I\'m reading the code correctly", the stacking algorithm is: for every file in this CFileItemList, check whether it matches any stacking regexp; if it does, check if other files in this CFileItemList match the same regexp this file does, starting with the next object in this CFileItemList. Yet, lines 2256-2257 cause the algorithm to skip checking the remaining list items if the file following _file1_ is not stackable with _file1_ (e.g. subtitles). This is somewhat challenging to explain, so let me give an example. Imagine a file list containing 4 items: 1: 2: 3: 4:  Now let\'s assume the user has set a stacking regexp that only matches AVI files (like in my case), e.g.:The first item matches this regexp. The algorithm should check (starting with item 2) whether the remaining items also match this regexp and whether or not they are stackable (matching title, ignore, extension; mismatching volume) with item 1. Yet, because item 2 does not match the stacking regexp, lines 2256-2257 will restart the algorithm for item 1 with a different regexp instead of giving the algorithm a chance to find other files matching the regexp and stackable with item 1 (namely item 3) in the rest of the list. I believe the wrong iterator is incremented at line 2256 and that line 2257 should not read _break_ but rather _continue_ instead. If I\'m right about the above, I believe the other _expr++/break_ combos also need to be changed. I\'ve come across this issue when some of my movies failed to stack properly only when subtitles were present in the same directory. This patch hasn\'t broken anything in my XBMC installation," yet obviously it needs to be reviewed by someone with better insight into XBMC\'s inner workings.

xbmc,689,closed,1,2012-02-13 13:54:50,23.43,,1,,b'b\' I don\\\'t have any stackable video files so I\\\'m not really affected by this. But let\\\'s assume I have all my movies in one directory with an NFO," a poster and fanart for each movie. Let\\\'s further assume I have a rather huge movie library (1000+ movies). That means I have at least 4000+ files in that directory. If every movie is divided into two parts it would even be 5000+ files. With your change the stacking logic will take the first video file and check it against all the other 3999/4999+ files (if there is no match) and then start with the next expression. Once that is done it moves on to the second file and checks the first expression against the remaining 3998/4998+ files and so on. That will result in one hell of a lot of iterations compared to the current implementation which does 2 checks per non-stackable item per expression. And regular expressions aren\\\'t among the cheap instructions. I agree that the current logic is not perfect and needs improving but I think just going through all the files might result in a noticeable slowdown depending on how many files are in a directory. I don\\\'t know about all the different flavours of stack-naming conventions out there in the wild but in your case a check for ""does the current filename only differ in the extension"" and depending on that check either aborting or moving to the next item would already solve your problem.

Maybe I should take a step back here to explain further how I came across this, maybe I am barking up the wrong tree. I keep my movies in separate folders. The way I add them to the library is I go to the _Files_ view, browse to the folder containing the movie, open the context menu for a folder and pick _Movie information_. XBMC should then stack the files and, provided the movie is not yet in the library, scrape movie information. With the default stacking regexps and the naming convention I\\\'m using, movies were frequently (not in all cases) stacked incorrectly (XBMC looked up information for __ instead of stacked __). Yet, what I failed to mention before is that when I entered the folder itself, movies were always stacked correctly. But when I open the context menu for a stacked item, there is no _Movie information_ item and I cannot add it to the library. When I added some debug code to the _StackFiles()_ routine, it turned out that:when I open the context menu for a folder, _StackFiles()_ is called for a CFileItemList containing all files in that folder,when I browse to the folder, _StackFiles()_ is called for a CFileItemList containing only the video files (which is why it works flawlessly). So then I tried creating a custom regexp to cover the first case as I thought the default regexps don\\\'t work with my naming convention. It still didn\\\'t work," so I thought ""whoa"," this is a bug"" and here we are. Of course I believe the discussion up until now has been productive", yet maybe there is something else that should be fixed that wouldn\\\'t require changing the stacking routine.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,

It is however able to delete the copy of the temporary file. The question is whether being able to delete the temporary file is part of the requirement that the test succeeds or fails. The copy functionality works but the delete doesn\'t but the test is called .  fails in CFile::Rename() and  also fails because it can\'t delete the initial temporary file (it can delete the copy of the temporary file). So there seems to be a problem with the generation and deletion of the temporary file. I\'m not 100% but I think the problem is that the temporary file is created by CTempFile and on creation it\'s opened and not closed again. So any call to delete etc will fail because there\'s still an open handle to that file. The problem is that our file factory does not know about CTempFile from the testing code and therefore doesn\'t forward the calls to Delete() etc to the CTempFile implementation. If I add a call to Close() right after calling OpenForWrite() in CTempFile::Create() these tests pass but a lot of other tests fail because they probably assume that the file is open and can be read from / written to.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem is: Gentoo provides libnfs-1.3.0 alright", but they unconditionally configure it with enable-tirpc. The reason for that, according to the Gentoo devs, is that libc will drop rpc support soon, so libtirpc seems the only route. enable-libtirpc, on the other hand, breaks NFS browsing for XBMC, because here, the libc RPC headers are used unconditionally, despite libnfs\'s pkgconfig stating otherwise. We had a long debugging session in the mentioned libnfs issue to find that. Only to find out that the maintainer is about to drop external RPC support completely. Thus, there are 3 (4) options:convince the Gentoo devs to drop enable-tirpc for 1.3.0 -fix XBMC\'s configure to use the correct rpc headers and libs (i.e. libtirpc vs. libc)update libnfs to the next release, which comes without external rpc dependenciesLeave Gentoo users with a broken NFS implementation Now," which option do you want to you choose? ;-)""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The large texture manager is handled the same way, though that has at least a 2 second delay between when the texture is last used by a control and the texture being deleted, which makes it somewhat unlikely that it\'ll still be used by the GPU. Still, if you think there\'s potentially a real issue, then one option is to move it back to Render() and then get rid of the code block that was causing Render() to be skipped when minimised in the Frodo branch.

It\\\'s quite odd that mingw-make can\\\'t cope with crlf endings since I guess this was not an issue with the old 0.10.2 ffmpeg.  Are we missing a ""miniwg"" settings file or something like that?Background:  The build env that was used is based on a ffmeg repo cloned from the ffmpeg n1.2 fork. Since it was a git repo it was also possible to utilizes local config settings like =false. As soon as the PR made it into the xbmc master repo", ffmpeg just became a regular directory which makes it impossible to use local git config settings.Temporary workaround:  A very temporary solution I\\\'ve tested is to re-checkout ffmpeg with =false but that is obviously a rather ugly solution!Possible solutions?  Does it exist any platform settings (local or global) in the minigw  environment that enables Mingw-Make to accept crlf instead of just lf?

Yet using IsLibCecActiveSource() like that would imply the forceType parameter only makes sense on the CECStandby() method. At the moment all the methods have their forceType parameter.

xbmc,2978,closed,body,2013-07-16 06:42:42,00:00,,,1,"b'b"" Implemented initial support for display and input on wayland compositors. The following items should work fine:Display", frame refreshDetecting and selecting different output modesMouse input (buttons, wheels, motion, cursor hiding)Keyboard input (key repeat) The following items are not implemented yetDirty regions (requires core work to support EGL_EXT_buffer_age) As was suggested in the previous review, libwayland-, libwaylandand  are now loaded as dynamic libraries so that there is no runtime dependency if we want to build in wayland support. Unfortunately, that comes at a cost we are no longer able to use a lot of the autogenerated protocol boilerplate and must instead use the protocol directly. As such, any changes to this branch which are strictly protocol related should really be encapsulated in the objects found in the xbmc::wayland namespace. Due to differences in the way the protocol operates between wayland 1.1 and 1.2+, there is no guaruntee that anything in the xbmc::wayland namespace is going to be running in the same thread. Usually this is not a problem, as the wayland objects are just there to manage the connection with a compositor in the background and don\'t interact with the rest of xbmc. The only shared state is the available output modes and xbmc does not make any assumptions about deterministic access to these anyways. There is unit, integration and acceptance test coverage for this branch. Acceptance tests require the weston SDK in order to be built. They also require a weston binary to be available on the system. They shouldn\'t require any special graphics hardware the tests use the no-op renderer so there\'s no checking for things with EGL_bind_wayland_display or the like. I\'ll need some testing to verify this though. Screenshot:![wayland-on-weston-on-x]url  Note if you\'re testing on wayland-drm: Video playback will skip and stutter. The reason for this is probably because xbmc doesn\'t have access to your audio hardware from the console session, so SoftAE will keep resetting itself as its unable to push any data to PA. 12:55  smspillaz: and as for weston-launch, depending on how new your      systemd (logind) is, weston-launch is broken The workaround is to explicitly make weston launch on the same console you\'re on," eg: Newer versions of weston-launch should handle this problem automatically.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is either ready to go in or it\'s still a work in progress. Any commits that are independent and required to core for support should be listed 1st so they can be seen right away. For example \'[aml] add macro for optional export resolving\'.  Move all unit tests to one commit. Right now they are spread across six commits that are all over the place. Condense all the refactoring and fixes, don\'t need to see the path to the final solution, the final solution is good enough. Case in point, the ATV2 port which brought in iOS support was condensed from 500+ commits to a little more than 10. NetManager PR (in progress) was 50+ commits to one.

Small independent commits are easierto work with and reason about. The reason is that when viewing the historyyou can see each change in the context of what is relevant to it, whichaides in understanding the purpose behind code. I do, however, agree that there is some scope here for merging togethersome commits. The test commits are a good candidate for this. TheWinEventsWayland split may also be a good candidate too but keep in mindthat this tricky to do and could take me about a week to get right. At thatpoint it becomes an  tradeoff. If it really is that importantthen I\\\'d be happy to do it. Keep in mind that I\\\'ve been aggressivelyrebasing this already its the culmination of 3 months work and could havebeen hundreds of independent commits :). I also agree on documentation.

xbmc,2978,closed,26,2013-07-16 06:42:42,1385.8,1,,,b'b\' The revised patchset contains:1. More comments (approximately 1000 lines more), especially in funky areas and along class boundaries to show where the main integration points are2. enable-wayland now implies enable-gles3. Some small build fixes (missing #include, not sure how I missed that one). I haven\\\'t done any squashing yet. There seems to be a mixed verdict on squashing and its one of those things that\\\'s more difficult to reverse once its done (reverting to a previous HEAD with reflogs doesn\\\'t count because there may have been subsequent changes). As such, I\\\'ve left the history as-is. I think that more squashing could potentially be a good thing, however I\\\'m mindful of the fact that squashing some parts together could be a week-long job handling conflict fallout, especially where files were split up. We\\\'ve got automated test coverage on most of this code so there\\\'s not a huge amount of risk involved, but its effectively letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. If the verdict is that squashing is desired before merge, then I\\\'ll go ahead and squash based on the plan I outlined earlier. Otherwise it might be better to just leave it be. Hopefully the revised documentation should help people a little bit in navigating their way around the codebase. I apologize that it has grown to a substantial size, although I\\\'d advise looking past the number of lines changed and more to the structure. I\\\'ve tried as much as possible to ensure that the codebase forms a directed acyclic graph of nodes, with the following lifecycle: WinSystemEGL creates EGLNativeTypeWayland which creates: -XBMCConnection creates a new xbmc::wayland::Registry object which listens on the main connection for any new global interfaces. Once a global interface becomes available (usually immediately) it creates a wrapper object for it (eg, Compositor, Shell, Seat, Output). The Seat global interface is injected into CWinEventsWayland which manages its internal state through xbmc::wayland::InputFactory xbmc::wayland::InputFactory contains a PointerProcessor," KeyboardProcessor and EventLoop. EventLoop is the implementation detail for CWinEventsWayland and represents the wayland message pipe. Calling CWinEvents::MessagePump will dispatch either wayland or partially processed wayland events for further processing. Both are of the former ""processor"" classes are registered with the xbmc::wayland::Pointer and xbmc::wayland::Keyboard once they come online. When a new pointer or keyboard event occurs"," they are forwarded on to the former two classes for ""processing"" where they are turned into XBMC_Event structures and forwarded on to CApplication. Since the entire state of the backend is encapsulated in these objects", that part of the backend is effectively torn down as soon as they are destructed. Once EGLNativeTypeWayland is gone," there should be no more owning references to any other objects in the system related to this backend. Please feel free to ask me questions before merging. I\\\'d hope that there is some general understanding of how things work as opposed to ""its a monster but we want it"". I\\\'ve tried to make the design as straightforward as possible", but some abstractions are a little contrived because dependencies needed to be separated for testing purposes. Also consider reading the test code it should provide some insight into how things are supposed to work.\'',,,,,,,,,,

Itincludes the black bars of a scope movie in the blu ray disc movie files.When a user creates a 1:1 unencoded rip of a bluray disc to use with xbmc the video filealso has the black bars.  The algorithm used to calculate the Aspect Ratio by the default video player in xbmcuses the entire video file, black bars with the movie content, thus causing all scope movies (2.35, 2.40, etc..)to have a 1.778 calculated Aspect Ratio value.  This incorrect value is written to xbmc\\\'smovie information database, overwriting any valid scope Aspect Ratio already there from a  file.To be clear this issue does not effect how a movie is displayed, only what is displayed in themovie information areas of xbmc during and after playback.  It goes without saying thecode used to fix this problem is not the optimum way to address the problem," it is a temporaryfix to be used until a developer familiar with the code used to calculate the Aspect Ratioin xbmc player is able to modify it to become ""black bar aware"".  One suggestion was to check ifthe code used to crop black bars in xbmc can be re-used to make the Aspect Ratio algorithm""black bar aware"". The  request addressed in this patch to  is described inthese xbmc forum threads: url url  I created the first thread to discuss possible solutions", track progress of mods done inxbmc-12.0 source code, and highlight difficulties in porting the working solution in xbmc-12.0to xbmc-13.0.  Significant progress was recently made in porting the fix to xbmc-13.0, this commitwas created for the xbmc master branch developers to review for inclusion to the xbmc-13.0 source code. Below is a cut from comment lines added to  describing the source code changes: File has been modified to prevent overwrites of valid Aspect Ratios taken from nfo fileswhen available.  To activate the new code it requires user intervention to create a flag file, typically donefrom a simple xbmc python add-on, but can be done manually if the user creates the file.When the  is removed, either by the python add-on script, or manual deletion by a userthe original code is used. The code changes consisted of adding a function, getAspect_Ratio_nfo, to parse the Aspect ratiofrom the nfo file, adding lines to define the active movie path within the function CGUIInfoManager::GetItemLabel,and lines added to two case statements VIDEOPLAYER_VIDEO_ASPECT, to write the Aspect Ratio of the nfo fileto the database so it is displayed correctly in the information menus within video player during playbackand LISTITEM_VIDEO_ASPECT to write the Aspect Ratio of the nfo file to the info database so it is persistent after stopping playback.  is the patch file for  to implement the  fix. One additonal note.  Skins for xmbc need to be modified to include png files that will display the correct icon for scopemovies (2.35, 2.40. 2.55, etc..).  It looks like the user ronnie\\\'s pull request 3182  to include the icons in the defaultconfluence skin, and common Aspect Ratios in was merged into the branch in 08 2013.\'',,,,,,

I\'ve also seen some cases where not all of the attributes get filled out at scan time, but after playback the remainder get filled in.  For these, perhaps we could keep a bit field and mark it when each attribute gets set.  Then overwrite if the bit fields don\'t match the db when playback stops.  Of course we\'ll have to actually encapsulate a class for this to work," which has historically been taboo. ;)""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xbmc,3701,closed,4,2013-11-22 23:46:16,1253.07,1,,,"b'b"" Based on jmarshallnz\'s comment went back and looked at how to keep valid Aspect Ratio info after playback by stopping the writes to streamdetails.  Added trivial code to the function UpdateFileState in  to check the item for any of the 10 current Aspect Ratios defined in ", using a logic block with statements for each valid Aspect Ratio, if any are found in item the write to streamdetails is bypassed.  When no valid Aspect Ratio is  found the current code is run to write the streamdetails with what the player .  To get the player info bar to display valid Aspect Ratio info already in item, added the same logic block to the VIDEOPLAYER_VIDEO_ASPECT case statement in . No other code change is required, and using this approach eliminates the thousands(millions??) of file system reads from the original attempt in this commit.  The logic statements could be moved to a new function that is called in both  and , and returns a boolean value that is used to accomplish the same thing. It might make things cleaner if large chunks of more advanced code needs  to be added to check for all the  oddball cases like the one t-nelson mentioned that still require updating streamdetails.  If it was determined other streamdetails, like the AudioCodec are not calculated correctly, we could do the same process in the VIDEOPLAYER_AUDIO_CODEC case statement, to have it displayed correctly in the videoplayer info tab.  Using a function call might even be more attractive to prevent multiple duplications of similar code lines. If this approach sounds reasonable, what is the best way to submit the changes for review, initiate a new pull request from a fresh clone of the current source, or modify the source in the branch of the current pull request?

By changing number 2, the action is sent to the dialog, rather than the window.

Can you have a look over it and any ideas for things which must be improved or are wrong. The current system in steps:Data is passed from CActiveAEBufferPoolResample to the DSP processing system if DSP enabled and minimum one add-on is available.All Add-ons are asked about the requested stream type to find available addons and modes", e.g. 5.1 Audio not need a stereo up mix.The system makes a list of master processing modes which are selectable from user.The system makes also a list of pre and post processing modes which are selectable and process point moveable inside Settings->System->Audio->Audio DSP SettingsOn data processing it goes over following steps:  1. Input processing Unmodified input stream and is send to all enabled add-ons for detection and error correction  2. Input re-sample Re sample of the input signal for the master processing, only one add-on is allowed for it.  3. Pre processing Used for any steps before master processing. All enabled add-ons functions are called to make this.  4. Master processing The main processing like, surround up mix or sound modification processes. Only one from user over menu selectable mode is allowed. Add-ons can pass multiple selectable modes to KODI. If input channel alignment on it is higher as requested output and the master mode does not perform a down mix it becomes handled from ffmpeg re sample after return of master function.  5. Post processing Used for any other steps like, volume correction, equalizer and much more. All enabled add-ons functions are called to make this.  6. Output re-sample Re sampling of the processing signal to KODI audio output processing. The pre and post processing modes can be selected and moved within processing chain on audio dsp settings inside Settings->System->Audio.

The stream index was introduced when their SPDIF renderer was introduced (and hasn\'t changed since 2005), so I wouldn\'t be confident of that being correct either, particularly as I suspect the stream index is always 0... As far as I can tell, the difference is in how planar and interleaved output are handled.  i.e. in planar audio the number of buffers is equal to the number of channels, whereas in interleaved you get a single buffer.  Various CA code out there (e.g. chromium and others) determine interleaved versus planar based on the number of buffers the device signals.  We don\'t do that, but I\'m guessing that we probably should, and that this may be the error that is being made on the more exotic HW that isn\'t working.  If this is the case, then adopting this change isn\'t the solution I don\'t think.

Also @herrnst signaled that this change made his sblive (or what it was) kinda work. It has a flawed driver so that it announces multiple streams with each only having ""1 channel"". With the former code his audio was just garbled. Witht this PR he at least gets the (sort off expected by the streams which are announced by the driver) mono output. I don\\\'t wanna argue really but once again it doesn\\\'t look like those buffers have anything to do with interleaved or planar audio. Or it seems drivers are free to do whatever they want with those buffers ;). Last thing the streamidx for the fireface user is 1 (hardcoded 0 brings hell into audio for him again).

xbmc,5561,closed,body,2014-10-23 06:15:54,00:00,,1,,"b'b\' Last weekend I was thining that it would be nice if we would support addons that simply provide files that could be used by internal code  by other addons. There would be no logic and nothing to be executed in those addons. An example use case would be image package addons that could be used by multiple skins (e.g. an image package of all studio logos). I started working on it and added a basic ""resource"" addon which is exposed through our VFS under a  path. Since I don\\\'t know much about skinning I decided to try another possible resource addon and came up with language addons. Every language in Kodi basically consists of a and a so there are only files and no other logic. So I came up with the addon extension point and addons. The files of a language are available through  . I have adjusted the startup code (had to move addon initialization before language loading) and added some logic to handle updates coming from old configurations. I have also added reloading of language strings if the addon providing the currently used language is updated. Furthermore I have added a dialog asking the user if he wants to switch to a newly installed language (same as for skins). I have converted all existing languages to addons but I\\\'m pretty sure that I messed some of them up. Furthermore I noticed that not all of the languages with a  have a . How does that work? Last but not least the language also had a file which doesn\\\'t seem to be  anywhere in our code base so I removed it. I have also tried to adjust the build scripts but that\\\'s completely untested right now. On win32 it\\\'s also not possible right now to choose the installed languages in the installation wizard. Furthermore Xcode will need updating. I have no idea how this fits into the tools used by @alanwww1 and our transifex project. Maybe with this it could become possible for language-specific teams to create an updated addon of their language themselves and submit them to the official repository to lessen the work @alanwww1 has to do on his own right now. TODOs:[x] we need to upload all addons to a repository and integrate it into our addon repository[x] I don\\\'t like having hardcoded[x] refreshing of the main addon repository doesn\\\'t work if the login dialog is enabled due to url [ ] the OK dialog letting the user know that we had to fall back to the English language because we couldn\\\'t find the configured language doesn\\\'t always show because Confluence\\\'s replaces the startup window with the home window which leads to the dialog being hidden. Whether the dialog is visible or not depends on timing. The same problem applies to the migration info dialog that @Memphiz added for the XBMC -[ ] we need to figure out if the windows installer properly deletes the old directory[x] android packaging still seems to include the old language files\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
xbmc,5561,closed,1,2014-10-23 06:15:54,32.75,,,1,"b""b' We discussed the resource addon for skins on devcon too", I think that would be a very nice thing for skins. Especially the more advanced ones which would let them to share icons etc. My thinking for skins was to use multipath when we mount the special skin folder, by looking at the dependencies. But a resource:// path would work just the same really, might be clearer from xml where the data comes from too (and might help with in extensions handle optional resource packs). Many games uses resource packs via physfs which is essentially a multipath with zips More on the topic of this PR. I think moving Addon initialization before everything is a sane approach, atleast the loading and usage of them if we want vfs and friends to be addons. It might be valid to discuss a future proof loading order and specify it in docs so we have it in writing. I think language addons would be a really good idea," would let us add languages independent of releases. Which could bring up the subject of using these packs for addon languages too.'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But IMO there\'s a difference there because it wouldn\'t really make sense to list them as usual addons. They should have a special integration that would show them either on the addon info dialog or in the addon settings dialog of a specific addon. But from a usage point of view they could work the same by exposing them through a path. One thing that might get tricky is to  a specific language addon of every installed addon when the user changes the language in Kodi. So if he switches from English to German we also need to download all the german language addons for every installed addon automatically. But for now I\'d like to keep it simple and see if anyone objects to the idea of resource and language addons. PS: And yes documenting the startup sequence (with potential dependencies) would be a good idea.

I don\\\'t object to use it for addons, skins as well, but that would put more load on team members who are handling addons. To make the language addons using the whole Transifex infrastructure, is by the way very easy, because ALL updated language files handled by us," is at one place in the  github repo url  They are always under the ""merged-langfiles"" directory. So the whole process can easily be automated. Maybe it is also possible that if the language file changes", the automated process get started and create the new version of the language addon. Or just make a weekly or so interval. But I think, we need to be careful, because the language files for all languages take up a LOT of bandwidth to download for each addon and skin.

I even tested, to rename the language directories to the new language codes in random addons. I just have two thoughts:If we use the language codes for language-addon names and language directories in this PR, we will have a really unideal situation, with totally different language codes used in all existing  files (for summary, description, disclaimer), on Transifex and for language directories and language-addon names. For example Dutch would be nl in all  and on Transifex, but it would be nl_NL for the language-addon name and nl_NL for the language directory name. This would cause a great confusion across our translators and maybe also the addon devs, why they would have to use two different codes in the  file and in the language directory. I would not say that it is unsolvable, but at least for me, this change would mean, that I would have to rebuild the complete translators database at Transifex, because there is no way to just rename a languages there. This is more than 1600 user to re-add to the new language groups manually. Not to speak of changing a lot of stuff in my sync utilities. But I can do it, if there is a GREAT plus using these xx_yy format language codes instead of having the existing ones. So I let you decide if it is really a benefit that is worth it.Changing over the source language name to en_GB, is also a big problem for me. I checked and I have this hard-coded all over my sync utils and scripts. So if it is not really necessary," please leave it as plain ""en"".BTW", I collected out the language codes we are using now, in Kodi repos and all addons existing and the language codes in this PR.

In this step I can do the whole rebranding stuff as well. Still I have some thoughts in my mind:The whole  file format this way is strange, because we will have an xx_YY format locale set for language and we will have a completely separate YY format code for region code. So for example I can choose de_DE for language, but under it will be selectable Austria as a region code. I think it will look strange, because normally this should be defined by the locale _YY part.The visible language is also not in line with the new codes at the moment. So when you select German, you will select de_DE instead. This is problematic when a Translator wants to sign up and tries to find the right language for him. maybe would be good to change the language names over as well.  @Montellese wrote that he is planning to remove theese  files completely, but how would we handle combinations like  that way ? I mean there is no language team like that currently. Maybe we could define fallback languages in the  language addon that it will pull in the de_DE and invisibly for the user, using that instead the English. But still this will result a lot more language addons that we have now in this PR.For both the above two problems it would be a solution that selecting the language name in GUI (German) and selecting the region (eg. Austria) will automatically choose the right and available language pack and the legacy language name to use with older addons. This is far the most simple solution from user perspective. What is your opinion guys ?For updating the  file I will need some kind of Version or API bump or something that can be read with my sync utility to separate the two systems. So solution suggestion I.Change this PR slightly to make Kodi able to actually use the region set in the GUI and choose the right language pack with the xx_YY locale format.Keep only the region specific info in  Solution suggestion II.Make additional ""dummy"" language packs with all the existing  combination with reference to fallback language addons.Delete  files. I think in GUI we should only show the language name when choosing a language and changing region would give us the complete locale. This means we have to strip down current ""language"" names like ""English (US)"" to simply ""English"". Not so much we have from this type.\''

xbmc,6474,open,body,2015-02-17 23:30:35,00:00,,,1,"b'b\' Well feature time. This PR adds the  based inapp update feature to Kodi on osx. Most osx users know this updating system from various other apps. Its the quasi standard updater. This PR does:1. add sparkle framework building to our target depends (we build it from source no binaries right? ^^)2. adds all the needed stuff to the osx project This is how it looks like when an update is available: url url url url  The user can either manually ""look"" for updates via the menu or let sparkle do its magic. He also can decide to skip only one version of kodi or if he doesn\\\'t want to update now he can delay it. He even can activate an auto update feature without user interaction. If you wonder why there is a public key in those commits. For security reasons we have to sign the DMG so that the updater can verify that the update is really done by us (i would hook the signing up to the release jenkins job or the alpha job in case we want to provide alpha update via sparkle). Basically the signing is done because of the same reasons we have to sign the apk file for android. What do you think? (given the risk free integration we could even think about taking this into 14.2 once its in we can publish versions via an serverside xml). As you can see the updatexml which holds the metadata about available updates can be defined in  (in case we want to have different files for alpha and final releases). For now i just would put them to the osx downloads on the mirror. Once we release we just kick the jenkins job (which is not adapted yet) which signs the dmg the sign process results in an dsa key hash which has to be added to the xml file (this is manual work like when i update cydia repo). XML file structure is straight forward (title", version, size, dsa hash, ). Yeah long text. :) wanted?\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We could aswell add a setting in our GUI which triggers a check for update. We could even completely use our GUI for all dialogs (because the API allows us to intercept all events like ""update found""","changelogs received"" ""update progress"" and so on. The latter is just a bit to much work for just trying it out. Well i think for the start i could just add a setting somewhere in Kodi which triggers a check for updates and either prints a dialog ""no updates found"" or the original native system dialogs for the update appear. The default is it checks once when starting the software and then once a day iirc.\''

Now, if you run  from the kodi root directory, it will no longer delete the checked in files in kodi\\\\, all paths are constructed relative to %~dp0 (the directory containing the script).2. get_ now reports a list of failed downloads at the end, so if something failed, you can see what it was.3. Fix a few places where errors were not handled," or missing directories were not created.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The top demuxer in that heap is selected for reading. **_Organizing the streams:_** Unfortunately this does not work out of the box because each demuxer d_i numbers its streams from 0 to n_i, but the dvdplayer numbers them from 0 to sum_i(n_i). Hence the dvdplayer can\'t determine if the current packet should be forwarded to the  player (because of the stream id mismatch). There are two solutions I can think of.

As you wrote", timer settings dialog currently does not offer the functionality to pick an epg event. Your expectation is correct. The logic in timer settings dialog is okay, IMO.

We could have other attributes if required like ""PreventCreateFromTimerList"" and so on.  Rather than Kodi core making hardcoded assumptions like ""all backens support a repeating epg timer with no epg info but dont support a single repeating epg timer with no epg info"" this would mean each addon can decide what types are appropriate for the scenarios. EG if based on @ksooo comments earlier", Kodi considers a repeating EPG timer with no epg info exists," then how come not a single EPG timer with no epg info?  You said that a keyword search counts as Epg Based but in WMC you can do a keyword search either for ""One Occurence"" or ""All Occurences"".

Im not sure of where other addons sit," but in Isengard (and infact since Frodo)  has had custom dialogs which allowed us to do series recording that supported quite a lot of the WMC .  Custom Dialogs are not without their issues but fundamentally we have had ""good"" series recording support a long time already. The changes being made in Kodi 16 are fantastic and particularly your receptiveness to take requests from all the disparate addons have left us in a pretty good place.  We are almost at feature parity with our existing custom dialogs and also support proper values for lifetime and priority.  So don\\\'t worry", the changes are USEFUL and whichever way the dust settles I will be doing whatever I can in  to be able to remove all the custom dialog stuff and tap into Kodi PVR Core. But I also dont intend to stop  for even greater flexibility and implementation on the kodi side it\\\'s just in my (and alot of people\\\'s nature).  I hope it isnt seen as bike shedding (arguing over trivial inconsequential details) because I do think these things are enhancements and also well thought out and of benefit to Kodi as a whole. So please dont take offense or feel bad, youve done an amazing job. For the record I dont really care for alot of the EPG scraping related stuff that @metaron-uk has gathered up, and feel that it is probably too  and risks the time frames, however the 2 items of most interest to me (which I also happen to feel are fairly straight forward and not contentious) are  [PVR] Add maxRecordings to APIurl  [PVR] Menu visibility controls for timer typesurl  So I really hope we can get these in intime and am happy to assist wherever I can (bearing in mind I am no c++ expert so do need  from time to time)\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The problem will always be that what looks fine initially turns out to have issues buried in the detail when you try and implement a solution based on it. From a mythtv perspective I think what\'s on the table for 3.0.0 should cover it from an API perspective for Jarvis. I have other ideas", but these should be implementable without an API change, so they can wait. Can you provide some advice on how best to go about PRing the addons for 3.0.0? I\'m guessing wmc can be done by @ryangribble , I can provide a PR for @janbar \'s doityourself branch for mythtv and hopefully you can handle tvheadend. Is it just a case of submitting PRs against the other kodi addon repositories (do you have a list?) which allow them to compile, do what they did before and reply \'not implemented\' to new functions? How much \'testing\' is necessary / support can be expected from the existing maintainers? I would struggle to install and run backends of each type in that timeframe to \'verify\' they work, especially for \'windows only\' or \'non-free\' backends (my household is linux and osx). I could however help fix them later if necessary / describe the required changes on a wiki somewhere. @ryangribble I can see some of my ideas will probably have to be dropped to meet the timescales, but I\'m sure I can get the basic scaper () ones done quickly. I hope they will speak for themselves. I have certainly found my \'hacked version\' useful. If there are any ideas on the table which you think are just bad, or you would never use, please say. I don\'t want to invest effort prototying a change which will die as soon as I present it. Similarly if you can see something which will prove to be \'essential\' for some other addon, I\'d love to get that in now.

xbmc,8015,closed,body,2015-09-11 08:17:47,00:00,1,,,b'b\' First step in improving browsing for classical music is to process the standard tags for composer (TCOM), conductor (TPE3) and Ensemble.  This could be considered a work in progress, but could be merged as an initial phase providing limited user improvements. Unlike popular music albums which usually have one album artist, classical music frequently has multiple artists soloists, conductor, orchestra and composer. The composer is the primary element used when selecting what you want to play, and although not a performer most classical music files will have composer name in the artist (or album artist) tag just to make them accessible on the various players (inc. Kodi).  Musicbrainz also treats composer as an artist. Once the artist list includes a mix of composers, orchestras, conductors, soloists (as well as pop artists)  it is useful to be able to see just one kind of artist at a time. Lack of player support for these tags means that users will have incorporated them in the artist and album artists tags. Rather than have extra tables or song attributes for these tags," my idea is to use these tags to identify the ""role"" that an artist has in the recording. An approach that could easily be extened to other as yet unsupported tags"," but wanting to try the concept first. This means a database change adding ""role"" as a attribute of the song_artist and album_artist tables. The UI aspect of this change is made available through folder type custom nodes. For example Implementing this change I have looked at the inital work on artist credits discussion between Night199UK and JMarshall. The original intentions to use JoinPhrase to construct artist names and get rid of the various strArtist and use of strutils::Join everywhere. This did not happen"," and despite being used to store "" / "" JoinPhrase is not used", neither is bFeatured. I have therefore removed these attributes (replacing them with role). I really have checked carefully before doing that. Not sure how much more of the design I should describe at this point, or if there is somewhere better for design documentation? I am hoping we can move the music library forward despite the lack of experienced dev team members even using the music side let along having time to consider design changes. From other PR it seems that @Montellese, @evilhamster, @Razzeee, and @zag2me are most likey to have an interest in music . Lots to discuss I am sure!!\'',,,,,,,,,,,

For readability it might be a good idea to split into several commits (maybe one for removing strArtist /JoinPhrase and one for adding roles)? As we discussed over PM\\\'s", I would prefer if the role are not defined by enum\\\'s but rather as strings (the idRole could reference a table with the different roles description). There are some use cases where this would be nneded; TMCL tags would be one, being able to add relationships from musicbrainz would be an other.  Haven\\\'t been able to read all the code yet, but started with the tagloader lib parts and it looks like you only load the first entry of a tag even though they should be able to contain a list of items. Also it looks like you are changing the upgrade steps for db version 54, isn\\\'t it a better idea to bump db version to 55 so you can separate your changes (and make sure they execute for the users that are on 54)?

The string (and denormalisation when stored in database) does make sense as a display value, the artist credits object makes sense too.

So now the GetArtists do not return all Artists from the table but only some based on a filter that no one is aware of. 3) To get all artists you need to filter on roleid = -1, first it\\\'s not documented, but more wrong : You need to use an undocumented internal magic number to do a filter on a public API. Completely insane.(And not talking about the fact that doing that filter returns data that you can\\\'t really use since you can\\\'t apply the filter manually since you do not have access to roledid and role.)

For scraping to be really effective we are dependant on having MBIDs, or at least well tagged music files. First we need to get users to tag their data and use the library.

The other reason is speed. Add a large music source for the first time, remember to scan it to library which is slow enough, and then wonder what on earth Kodi is doing while it scrapes additional info off the net.

You know me," I hate to change other people\\\'s work without understanding it fully. I can only guess it might have something to do with the v2.3 spec that says ""/"" is always the separator for TPE1 (artist) and TCOM (composer). Of course this has the "" problem""", and so regardless of what the spec says Kodi applies the separator setting to spltting TPE1 and all the other tags for all the versions. It makes most sense to be consistent and have TXXX:ARTISTS treated the same as the other tags. No idea how many of our users tag with v2.3 and use the ARTISTS tag (along with MusicbrainzIDs), not manys I suspect. But at least one does and had reasonably used the default space-slash-space to separate names in the ARTISTS tag (just like they do in TPE1 or TCON etc.), only to get  space issues. If any users have tagged v2.3 with just slash as a spacer in this one tag it seems reasonable to ask them to change it. And we will only discover them, if they exist,  in real world use. @Rouzax, @Scott967 and @zag2me perhaps you could give this a try especially with any v2.3 tagged files with ARTISTS tag, as you did the original PR.

Changing to the default Estuary Skin and restarting Kodi this is successful every time.  Case 2 should have been successful since the Custom Skin wasn\\\'t the active skin but using Sysinternals Process Explorer showed that Kodi had maintained an open file handle on the  file in the Custom Skin. This was preventing overwriting the Custom Skin with the updated version held in the temporary file. Case 3 restarting Kodi after switching to the default Estuary Skin releases the open file handle on the Custom Skin  file and the update is then successful.  Now with Kodi still running and the Custom Skin active I used Process Explorer to close the open file handle on  and then used ""install from zip file"" to update the Custom Skin. Success! The Custom Skin had updated correctly but since the file handle on  had been closed the skin appeared without any textures", restarting Kodi solved this and showed that the skin had been correctly updated. I repeated this several times to make sure and every time the update was successful.  If one of the themes, either Curial or Flat, was selected in the Custom Skin then Kodi also maintained an open file handle on this which had to be closed for a successful skin update.

Currently is this CAddonInfo still as static in CAddon class. This is must be removed complete (on next requests) and only given as shared_ptr to the addon class.  Goal is (and used on kodi-agile) that Kodi e.g. go over the addon directory," if there is a addon with  becomes this by the constructor of CAddonInfo read and the class stored in a list on addon manager. What Kodi does with it does not interest. This mean also a related addon class is stll not needed and created.  After all steps are done contains the addon class only a contructor where the stored parts becomes given.  XML parsing must only be done inside this class and should not done somewhere outside. To do outside bring a lot bad parts and nothing good.  Big problem is to bring in without destroy something and allow a better review. This need for short times bad parts. Thats why I mostly use screensaver where is not so critical.  '""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s called the factory pattern and it\'s great for this sort of thing. Not too long ago this exact \'inside this class\' spaghetti was removed. And the reasons for that was:  Having complex logic like parsing and filesystem code in constructor is an anti-pattern. It breaks testability.  It makes error handing complicated as your only option is to leave objects in an invalid state and work around it by setting flags (this is exactly what you have done with m_usable)  It\'s a pain to deal with configuration as every new config must be added to every constructors. Makes it a lot harder to construct something partially when needed. E.g. local addons have metadata from the filesystem and from the database", and potentially also from the repository and they must all be combined.  Additionally, the way this is implemented violates the single responsibility principle. now holds the info, it holds state, it\'s an xml parser, it\'s an json parser, it\'s responsible for the extensions.  The same for  : it\'s hold extension info, it\'s a parser," it\'s a mutable collection. This is all effects of having the classes themselves do the parsing.  The solution I explained in my previous post does not have these issues. ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xbmc,13138,closed,body,2017-12-05 20:19:12,00:00,1,,,"b'b"" ## Description auto resume the media which was used during enter sleep mode and resumes it on wake with forced play (playerstate handling is already implemented as part of resume point but I don\'t know why the player state is allways empty", this issue does force play on my PR) But this is only the first step, a very basic solution which could be improved step by step.  We do already have something similar for PVR resume called startupaction:  If we disable startupaction liveTV it does the following onwakeup: [x] resume to home screen [x] resume to settings screen [x] resume to libary screen [x] resume to any subpages of the screens [x] resume to list selection [ ] resume to any player pause [ ] resume to any player playback [ ] resume to LiveTV player playback  if we enable autostart action LiveTV it does this onwakeup: [ ] resume to home screen [ ] resume to settings screen [ ] resume to libary screen [ ] resume to any subpages of the screens [ ] resume to list selection [ ] resume to any player pause [ ] resume to any player playback [x] resume to LiveTV player playback  As you see, enable startupaction LiveTV is even worse because it doesn\'t resume anything except LiveTV.  This PR used to fix resume to any player pause resume to any player playback but the first step would be only player playback  ## Motivation and Context url  If you want to resume your paused movie after kodi did enter sleep mode. You can\'t change this behaivor with an addon, because you don\'t know the last player state because our sleep handling does change it. It\'s not possible to differentiate between user did close the player or kodi did close the player on sleep.  Don\'t miss this discussion: url **More about my usecase:** I did install kodi on my pvr server which mean I can\'t force sleep because running recordings and other clients watching tv would block this Usecase is the following: I do pause a video, host is going into standby because of idle and on resume I want to find my paused video.  On resume I want to see my last player state without forcing play because I don\'t want to playback if the server was just started by PVR.  My stop watching action is also special. Instead of sleep which is not possible during recording or other clients watching TV, I use to call a prepair idle script on my IR Remote power button to put everything into idle to trigger autostandby when PVR is done. On start watching action my script does send play if player existing or open LiveTV if no player is online. The start watching script gets triggered by IR Remote power button as well. In detail there are 2 ways to trigger start watching on IR wakeup action  or if the host is already running it gets executed during recive IR power button. PVR recording wakeup and client WOL request don\'t trigger Start watching script.  My current problem is that I am loosing my paused video on sleep. And you can\'t fix this with Python because Python gets an stopPlayer and I don\'t know did user hit stop or did kodi hit stop which result into an unknown last player state.  The straight forward solution would be to get rid off of the player termination, this would fix it. But as we point out there are some plugins which can\'t go on if player was to long in idle. @FernetMenta did point the following out about skip player termination Instead of make all the plugins able to reconnect to the stream we decided to terminate the player and reconstruct it as I did in this PR.  My next PR could maybe an speed improvement where I do check if we really need the player termination. This would make kodi player behaive like every other local file video player like MPC-HC, VLC or WMP but the else would still fix our existing plugins which can\'t handle closed network connections or sessiontimeouts.  This braking change would case an issue for users who don\'t handle PVR wakeups and WOL wakeups: An resume to play would cause an media playback during PVR recordings and during WOL. This is only an issue for Kodi users because only kodi did implement a player termination on sleep and users are not aware of needed wakeup handling. Other PVR clients like DVB Viewer do already resume play if you don\'t implement any exit action on sleep. Which means non kodi users would know who to handle this, but it\'s an unknown thing for kodi users. What do you think about this issue? Should we disable it by default with an hint about this issue with PVR recordings and WOL?  A new setting like startup window would handle this as well as all other issues of my braking change: wakeup action setting: close player (default, because this is the current behaivor but it would not apply livetv) player force playback (warning: PVR recording or WOL event would couse kodi to playback your last file) keep player state (warning: if you enter stanby on state play an PVR recording or WOL event would couse kodi to playback your last file) startupaction (is used to reenable the existing startupaction feature)  There is another way to fix my problem: create a python event onsleep which get fired before player termination to grep the last player state with python. But there could be a issue with the python sleep event, if to many plugins do subscribe this event we may get problems with our sleep handling.  ## How Has This Been Tested? It got testet on Windows 10 64bit with an Intel Apollo Lake and the intel graphic driver 15.60.  This is only poorly tested and should not get applied until I did some more tests.

This PR used to fix resume to any player pause resume to any player playback but the first step would be only player playback  I did forgot to give you the context oft things which follow after this PR.  I did install kodi on my pvr server which mean I can\'t force sleep because running recordings and other clients watching tv would block this Usecase is the following: I do pause a video", host is going into standby because of idle and on resume I want to find my paused video.  On resume I want to see my last player state without forcing play because I don\'t want to playback if the server was just started by PVR.  My stop watching action is also special. Instead of sleep which is not possible during recording or other clients watching TV, I use to call a prepair idle script on my IR Remote power button to put everything into idle to trigger autostandby when PVR is done. On start watching action my script does send play if player existing or open LiveTV if no player is online. The start watching script gets triggered by IR Remote power button as well. In detail there are 2 ways to trigger start watching on IR wakeup action  or if the host is already running it gets executed during recive IR power button. PVR recording wakeup and client WOL request don\'t trigger Start watching script.  My current problem is that I am loosing my paused video on sleep. And you can\'t fix this with Python because Python gets an stopPlayer and I don\'t know did user hit stop or did kodi hit stop which result into an unknown last player state.  The straight forward solution would be to get rid off of the player termination, this would fix it. But as we point out there are some plugins which can\'t go on if player was to long in idle. @FernetMenta did point the following out about skip player termination Instead of make all the plugins able to reconnect to the stream we decided to terminate the player and reconstruct it as I did in this PR.  My next PR could maybe an speed improvement where I do check if we really need the player termination. This would make kodi player behaive like every other local file video player like MPC-HC," VLC or WMP but would fix our existing plugins which can\'t handle closed network connections or sessiontimeouts  ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And based on my experience with other videoplayers I do just need a sleep handling without player termination. Then I did fine all the resume plugins and all the users who did search for it.  This braking change would case an issue for users who don\\\'t handle PVR wakeups and WOL wakeups: An resume to play would cause an media playback during PVR recordings and during WOL. This is only an issue for Kodi users because only kodi did implement a player termination on sleep and users are not aware of needed wakeup handling. Other PVR clients like DVB Viewer do already resume play if you don\\\'t implement any exit action on sleep. Which means non kodi users would know who to handle this", but it\\\'s an unknown thing for kodi users. What do you think about this issue? Should we disable it by default with an hint about this issue with PVR recordings and WOL?  There is another way to fix my problem: create a python event onsleep which get fired before player termination to grep the last player state with python. But there could be a issue with the python sleep event, if to many plugins do subscribe this event we may get problems with our sleep handling.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has and a reference to a file. For every time watched", we add a new row.  So this is much richer than the old fields, as we can have multiple  entries for the same file. We\'re basically emulating the old fields while adding the new table to use in the future.  This first implementation however will focus on only having this internal and handling it correctly in core. We will need to expose it to the outer world in a later PR.  ## How Has This Been Tested?  Very little. It seems to work fine on migration and leanback. And it also seems to safe fine on  . It also sets playCount to 0 instead of at the moment, not sure if this causes regressions.

Which will be hard to rip out and replace everywhere, but other then that pretty straight forward. So the user now only sees the relevant infos from his current rewatch session.

What I really think should be done is that the table is added as _new_ functionality separate and independent of the and columns in the table. If there is a requirement to expose  /  then do so as two NEW properties as this will result in a lot less complexity and users of the existing  /  functionality can continue unaffected. It\\\'s not ideal, but a better alternative than fudging the data.

xbmc,14209,closed,body,2018-07-21 01:06:57,00:00,,,1,"b'b"" ## Description  Introduced in url  RetroPlayer uses two files for autosave: a .sav file for the memory data", and an .xml file for metadata. This combines both memory data and metadata into a single .sav file.  In this PR, FlatBuffers is used to serialize metadata. This library was chosen for performance reasons, as it is the only popular serialization library that allows for zero-copy. Although it requires a native compiler, the target library is headers-only.  Backwards compatibility with XML files was not retained due to the extra code it would take, and RetroPlayer is still alpha software.  As a result of this PR, savestates are several hundred kb smaller, half as many files, and  should be faster on slow devices due to skipping costly XML operations.  I spent a LONG time on the build system stuff," and I\'m not sure if I did everything correctly.  ## Motivation and Context First abstraction for the new Saved Games manager.  ## How Has This Been Tested? Tested on Windows 7 and OSX. ## Types of change  [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue) [ ] Improvement (non-breaking change which improves existing functionality) [ ] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality) [x] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to change) [ ] Cosmetic change (non-breaking change that doesn\'t touch code) [ ] None of the above (please explain below) ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It should be noted in the ""system info"" screen of Kodi"," it says the PVR is still connected. ## Possible Fix The only resolution currently is to close Kodi 18 and restart.  ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. Put the computer into Sleep mode (with Kodi running). 2. Wake up the computer after 5+ mins (with Kodi running). 3. User clicks on any of the ""TV"" related menu options (to see channels", recordings, etc). 4. Check if any information appears (channels, recordings, etc)  ### Debuglog Not available. ### Screenshots  Here are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem:  url ### Your Environment Used Operating system:  [ ] Android  [ ] iOS  [ ] Linux  [ ] OSX  [ ] Raspberri-Pi  [X] Windows  [ ] Windows UWP Operating system :  Kodi version: 18 Beta 3, for the specific build version refer to screenshots.

(or at least append instead of overwriting)  ## Actual Behavior Dialog().ok() function overwrites text from the second argument with the third and fourth\\\'s default value (empty string)  ## Possible Fix (I don\\\'t speak C++) My calculated trace are these files and functions  ShowOKDialogLines [:39]url  ShowOKDialogLines [:71]url  Interface_GUIDialogOK::show_and_get_input_line_text [:50]url  ShowAndGetInput [-addon-dev-:83]url It looks like the first file is the issue. It looks to be moving each arg into the array without checking anything (std::move) I\\\'m also not sure whether checking would be suited here or somewhere else in the chain.  I wrote a python wrapper to elicit the correct behaviour, if anyone\\\'s curious [result of python wrapper function]url I\\\'ve just realised before submitting this that my wrapper works, but still doesn\\\'t follow the docs ([here]url  as only line1 is supposed to be multiline and I\\\'m dumping my remaining multiline string in the last argument (line3).  ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. Make or modify a python addon with the following code: 2. Trigger the addon 3. Notice that multiline 2 and 3 are blank ### Debuglog The debuglog can be found here:  I only gave part of the debug log as it\\\'s verbose af It starts just before clicking my context menu item, the linebreak is after the dialog box was shown. The remaining is clicking the okay button. It\\\'s probably useless as I suspect the code is technically doing the right thing.

To make it clearer I\\\'m using a mock-up library with just 16 movies starting with every letter from **A** to **P**. The movies have been added to the library in alphabetical order: 1st **A**pocalypse Now, 2nd **B**raveheart... 16th **P**ulp Fiction.  When using the Estouchy skin," the ""Recent Movies"" list in the home screen includes just the first 10 movies in alphabetical order. When movies are added to my library", they\\\'re not included in the list unless they\\\'re in the top of the alphabetical order. (Screenshot 1)  The recent movies are listed as expected if I navigate to Movies -I get the same expected behaviour if I navigate to Movies## Expected Behavior Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen: Recent Movies should list the new movies in the library. ## Actual Behavior Recent Movies is showing the top movies in alphabetical order. ## Possible Fix I found a workaround by editing the line 110 in Original  Possible Fix   ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. Enter Kodi and navigate to Estouchy\\\'s home screen.  ### Debuglog The debuglog can be found here: url  ### Screenshots  Here are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem: Screenshot 1: Recent movies in the home screen ![screenshot1]url Screenshot 2: Movies -![screenshot2]url Screenshot 3: Movies-![screenshot3]url  ## Additional context or screenshots (if appropriate) Here is some additional context or explanation that might help: See #14813. ### Your Environment Used Operating system:  [ ] Android  [ ] iOS  [X] Linux  [ ] OSX  [X] Raspberri-Pi  [ ] Windows  [ ] Windows UWP Operating system : Ubuntu 18.04  Kodi version: 18.0-BETA5   *note: Once the issue is made we require you to update it with new information or Kodi versions should that be required.

xbmc,14866,open,body,2018-11-13 12:23:17,00:00,1,,,"b'b"" ## Bug report Videos with graphics-based subtitles are stretched", regardless of video aspect , to fill the screen. (Discussed here: url ## Expected Behavior The subtitles shouldn\'t be stretched or distorted depending on the output resolution, but rather the  resolution.  ## Actual Behavior For example, any video with an aspect ratio wider than 16:9 playing on a standard 16:9 monitor, Kodi stretches the subtitles vertically, across the black bars in a distorted fashion. Subtitles also get stretched stretched horizontally if you play a 4:3 video on a 16:9 display.  ## Possible Fix Graphics based subtitles contain data pertaining to the output dimensions, currently this is ignored. Even the video dimensions are ignored. All that needs to be done is to take these values and apply them when rendering the subtitles.  Aditionally, as discussed in the thread above, I thought it would be neat to have a setting in Player Settings Each caption in  subtitles have a positional value, but they are almost always the same the bottom-centre of the screen. You could have a setting \'override graphical subtitle positioning\' which ignores positions the subtitles positions them according to the \'Subtitle position on screen\' value. Treating each image in the subtitles as an  caption  ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Play a video wider / taller than Kodi\'s output dimensional ratio with graphics based subtitles VobSub () or PGS (sup) 2. Observe the stretching.  ### Debuglog N/A  ### Screenshots  Here are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem:  The video I\'m using has dimensions of 1920x818, as do the embedded VobSub subtitles, display output is 1920x1080.

What I failed to mention originally was that the subtitle I used in the example was cropped using the aforementioned BDSup2Sub because I assumed the dimensions of the subtitles had to match the video", otherwise the looked squished in VLC.  But after looking at other rips online, I\'ve realised no one else does this, they leave the subtitles untouched. If the video is sourced from a bluray the subtitles will always say it belongs to a 1920x1080 video, even if the video has been cropped to remove the black bars. I couldn\'t find a single example whereby the ripper had adjusted graphics-based subtitles after cropping the video like I was doing. I looked at a couple versions of La Dolce Vita (which I got the original screenshots from) and they rendered perfectly in Kodi, VLC on the other hand was _not_ so beautiful:  ![kgisivs]url ^ If you\'ve seen the film you\'ll know you cannot trust this man.  If you changed the default behaviour in Kodi to my preference, you\'ll upset everyone else who gets their TV & Film from publicly available rips (ie, from torrent sites).

Currently each addon requires to put the BIOSse on a directory USER_. As discussed in [this]url  and subsequent posts with @garbear", this is a design flaw because many BIOSes are shared among cores. With the current implementation this is not possible. The system directory is a property of the libretro frontend, not of the cores.  Another problem is that the savestates are created next to each ROM. ROM directories must not be writable by the libretro frontend (that is, Kodi).  ## Expected Behavior  A better implementation is to create the system, savestates and savefiles directories in a special directory in USER_DATA. For example:   Kodi core is expected to create these directories and use them instead of the current directories.  ## Current Behavior  Explained in the bug description. The current implementation works, however it complicates a lot the setup of emulators in Kodi Leia. The proposed implementation is based on Retroarch behaviour," it\'s more efficient in terms of disk space and easy to set up.  ## Possible Fix  Explained in the Expected behaviour.  ### Your Environment Used Operating system: tested on Debian Linux amd64 architecture with a custom-built Kodi version cloning Github repository.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sometimes," the dialog ""Kodi has stopped responding"" comes up over the black screen; other times", Ctrl-Alt-Del is needed to invoke Task Manager and then the dialog is visible. The only solution is to kill Kodi. RC1 is unusable in a system where all v18 beta builds have been usable. ## Expected Behavior Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen: Well, I\\\'d expect Kodi v18 to start, like in the betas... ## Actual Behavior But it always crashes. ## Possible Fix  ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. I don\\\'t know how to reproduce the bug on other systems, don\\\'t have another system or even variations in hardware to test, this is an integrated HTPC. 2. Find an Nvidia ION-based HTPC running Windows 7 x64 and install v18 RC1? 3. Start Kodi ### Debuglog The debuglog can be found here: url  (x86) url  (x64) They hang on the same place, but the stack traces are different. In x86 the stack trace is In x64 the stack trace is empty.  There are no screenshots to be taken (blank screen)  ### Your Environment Used Operating system:  [ ] Android  [ ] iOS  [ ] Linux  [ ] OSX  [ ] Raspberri-Pi  [x] Windows  [ ] Windows UWP Operating system : Windows 7 x64  Nvidia driver 342.01 WHQL (latest and final version for this chipset)  Kodi version: 18.0 RC1  Hardware: Asus S1-AT5NM10E (Atom D525, Nvidia ION-II GT218) [(full specifications)]url Not sure if relevant, but x86 stack trace indicates there can be a relation because it mentions plugins: I noticed that the RC1 Kodi installer, unlike all installers beforehand, did not show the option to have InputStream plug-ins as an optional install.

xbmc,14939,open,body,2018-11-25 16:20:36,00:00,1,,,"b'b\'   ## Bug report ### Describe the bug 24hz movies playback (with ""_Adjust display refresh rate: Always_"") is stuttering a lot when ""_Allow Hardware Acceleration VTBDecoder_"" is _ON_. The image is very jerky to the point of making it impossible to watch"," the sound is completely shifted.  If user set ""_Allow Hardware Acceleration VTBDecoder_"" to _OFF_ things goes a lot better (despite some small stuttering every 10/15 sec) but CPU usage is very High.  There are no visible issues when playing videos at 50hz and 60hz.   ## Expected Behavior The display should be set to 24hz (for 24hz movie) and the video playback must be completely fluid without shifting the sound and image. Like it was in Kodi v17.   ## Actual Behavior Display refresh rate is correctly set to 24hz (using this []url  _Hardware acceleration_ is **ON** and _Adjust refresh rate_ is **ALWAYS** but display is stuttering.  **Note**:  In Kodi v17 refresh rate change was sent to TV just one time. In v18", the change rate is sent to TV three very fast consecutive times (less than 1 sec delay between each). ## Possible Fix No known workaround other than by ceasing to display movies in 24hz. Disabling Hardware Acceleration VTBDecoder is not really viable as it leads to very High CPU usage and tends to increase frame drop when CPU goes to 100%.  **Noteworthy point 1:** If an active ARD (Apple Remote Desktop) session is open and active to remote control the server that runs Kodi, the stuttering almost disappear. **Noteworthy point 2:** A similar behavior found if user tries to Screen-capture (Cmd Shift 4 then space then left mouse button ) while Kodi is playing. When screen-capture is in fullscreen selection (using \\\'space\\\' shortcut) macOS turns the active screen to transparent blue. During this period (screen colored in blue," screen capture not yet taken) the stuttering completely disappear (but the screen is ""covered"" with a transparent blue filter).  It looks like something is broken in hardware acceleration of VTBDecoder in Kodi v18. Those issues are not present in v17.  ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:   _This procedure requires that Kodi is connected to a TV set that supports 24p / 24hz frequency rates._  0. **macOS**: delete (or rename to keep a backup) -1. **Kodi**: Run Kodi once to let it create its default configuration in  .

I\'m not a developer and I can\'t help with the code, only with the tests. However, the problem described in this ticket is major and blocking and makes the use of Kodi 18 simply impossible. Workarounds to this problem degrade the user experience to such an extent that they cannot be considered a solution, even temporarily. Kodi v17 still works very well and I would continue to use it.

We are not talking here about a cosmetic problem with the graphical interface but about the most important functions of the solution: playing videos like not other solution is able to.  I\'m not saying it\'s easy and it needs to be fixed right away, but v18 has been available for months, 18.1 is coming, v19 will eventually come soon but regression is still present without much visibility if it can, one day, be eliminated. A little frustrating, yes," but nothing really serious \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x84  We just always wish Kodi the best!""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

xbmc,14947,closed,body,2018-11-26 06:04:51,00:00,,1,,b'b\'   ## Bug report ### Describe the bug Here is a clear and concise description of what the problem is:  I\\\'ve created a media source for TV Shows pointing to a local file system folder (probably not relevant but, just in case," the information provider is set to ""Local information only"" as I use Ember Media Manager for collecting shows info). When playing the files through the Media Library node AND ""Play next video automatically"" is enabled for ""Episodes""", the external subtitles files are not displayed nor loaded (the list of available subtitles while playing the video is empy). The subtitle files are named appropriately though (using the same name as the video, but with a language suffix and the subtitle type extension)," and they are loaded and displayed properly when the same files are played through the media source node directly (instead of ""TV Shows""", use Videos The problem might be related to this other issue: url The following forum thread mentions the problem described (and also provides a work-around to the issue): url ## Expected Behavior Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen: The external subtitles files should be loaded and displayed, in the same way they are when files are played through through the files nodes or when play next episodes automatically is disabled.  ## Actual Behavior As stated above," the external subtitles files are not loaded when playing the files through the Media Library node if ""Play next video automatically"" is enabled for ""Episodes"". ## Possible Fix This seems to be related to the different way Kodi addresses the files when playing through the Media Library node vs when playing through the Files node (see attached screenshots).  ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. Create a TV Shows media source pointing to a local folder with shows containing external subtitle files. 2. Enable ""Play next video automatically"" for Episodes by going to Settings -3. Go to TV Shows and attempt to play an episode of one of the added shows. Subtitles will not be displayed", attempting to browse the available subtitles won\\\'t show them either.  ### Debuglog The debuglog can be found here: []url ### Screenshots  Here are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem:  Browse subtitles, when playing file through TV Shows node with play next episode automatically enabled. ![image]url  Browse subtitles, when playing file through created media source node or through TV Shows node with play next episode automatically disabled. ![image]url (Notice the URL the subtitles are being searched on) ### Your Environment Used Operating system:  [ ] Android  [ ] iOS  [ ] Linux  [ ] OSX  [ ] Raspberri-Pi  [x] Windows  [ ] Windows UWP Operating system : Windows 10  Kodi version: Kodi 18 (Leia) RC1 *note: Once the issue is made we require you to update it with new information or Kodi versions should that be required.

Suggest that your corrected Kodi VerRC3 NOT be installed overtop an exiting KODI installation", but only as a fresh install.  As previous stated by me, in email, I tested \\xe2\\x80\\x9c* PR15116-merge-armeabi-v7\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which was firstly installed overtop a previous installation (on a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKIII media box\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) with approximately 100 video files in the Kodi dbase. At first I actually did have problems so I uninstalled Kodi from the box and then re-install your program as a \\xe2\\x80\\x98clean\\xe2\\x80\\x9d installation, then all worked well as was required. But, the video library in this case was not extensive and a re-build was quick. Thus, a positive test was confirmed quickly.  I then proceeded to test \\xe2\\x80\\x9c*PR15116-merge-arm64-v8\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and again installed over an existing RC3 installation (as was done above in the KIII box) but this time in a Nvidea-Shield box. I was presented with similar subtitle control problems which froze the video followed by Kodi shutting down completely. I followed by deleting the Kodi installation (which had your corrected version installed overtop an existing RC3) AND reinstalled your new file version as a fresh install. All works well now. My video list is extensive and it takes over 24 hours to re-build the dbase.  So, may I advise that if your version is released into the wild you might want to warn users that it be freshly installed and NOT overtop an existing installation.  Unless," you view this as a defect because generally most new versions maybe installed overtop existing earlier version.  RK'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is displayed immediately in 17.6.  During the delay showing the playlist a pop up message box appears titled ""Scanning Media Information"" and saying inside  I have never seen this message box in 17.x.  ## Expected Behavior Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen: The top-level music menu should be displayed immediately. The playlist should be displayed immediately. Generating a party mode playlist should take less than 10 seconds.  ## Actual Behavior Displaying the top-level music menu takes 4 5 seconds. Displaying the current playlist takes 5 to 7 seconds Creating a party mode playlist takes 30 seconds.  ## Possible Fix  ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. Start Kodi 2. In the top-level menu click Music. Observe the time taken for it to be displayed. 3. In the Music menu pick Party Mode in the pull right option menu.   Observe the Mixing Drinks pop-up displayed for 30 seconds following by 5 7 seconds of empty screen before the playlist is finally displayed. 4. Go full screen so the OSD is displayed. 5. Press backspace and observe the 5 7 seconds delay before the playlist is displayed. 6. Press backspace and observe the 4 -5 seconds delay before the Music top-level menu is displayed. 7. Repeat ad nauseum.  ### Debuglog The debuglog can be found here:  url I did the above steps several times while this log was being captured.  ## Additional context or screenshots (if appropriate) Here is some additional context or explanation that might help: There is also a huge delay the first time you visit the Add-Ons node in the main menu.

With help from @MilhouseVH I now understand _why_ the start up of party mode is so slow on MySQL. There is a general MySQL optimizer limitation when using aggregate functions within subqueries as colums in a view. See url  and url  . Along with not using indices on correlated subqueries, this is yet another example of what a poor RDBMS MySQL is, and why users should be surprized by poor performance. Since Jarvis url  the artist datadded has been derived from the songs (rather than be stored directly in the artist table) , and  has included a subquery as a column expression.  As a result even to fetch a single row from MySQL scans the entire artist table first. At the start of party mode the artistview is queried separately for each artist of the first 10 songs This is what is taking >1s per song. For comparison on SQLite it takes a mere1ms, yes 1000 times faster and MySQL will be even slower depending on how many artists are in the db.  This general weakness of the MySQL optimiser will be effecting many queries involving albums or artists (views of both have subqueries as columns), but the slowness is particularly noticeable in party mode which is unique in fetching rows one at a time. Elsewhere e.g. songs or artists nodes, many rows are being fetched and so the full table scans that happen are less noticeable. This is ironic as party mode was created as a quick alternative to showing the songs node on large libraries (which is slow for other reasons not the db).  I will look at a fix of party mode to avoid this MySQL issue, if I can achieve an improvement without changes to the schema. But since it has been happening since Jarvis, and I don\'t know anyone else has noticed or complained, I don\'t think there is the need to rush into anything risky at the stage in the release cycle of v18.  I intend to review the use of in the music library for v19 anyway, I will certainly keep this issue in mind when I do. If we really want to take efficiency on MySQL db seriously (and fight the pathetic optimiser) without compromising the mainstream SQLite implementation, then there are many areas that can be visited. How far I will be able to get alone that road I don\'t know," but undertsanding the issue is a good first step. ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If it takes more than 1s to get a connection, something Kodi does multiple times, then many things are going to be slow.  Server caching could be contributing, and the  of **skip-name-resolve** cleared the cache which was allowing v18 to be faster sometimes (e.g. when disabled), but has not refilled. Why has this shown up on v18? Well since alpha 1 Kodi uses MariaDB Connector 3.0.3 client library to connect to MariaDB and MySQL databases, replacing the MySQL 5.1.55 client libraries previously used. The combination of that with your 5.5.59 MariaDB on OSX and network setup could be making lookup slow to resolve addresses. @MarkCallow  it could just come down to needing to update to MariaDB 10.3 but I can not be sure that will solve it. Other users are using v18 with 5.5  without these connection delays, so it is not just a simple matter of connector compatibilty. What settings do you have for MariaDB," any file? Or running as default config?  You could you try disabling Zeroconf from within Kodi. Kodi announcing over zeroconf could be triggering difficulties in MariaDB ability to resolve addresses over zeroconf.  The other thing to try is using actual IP address as  in  rather than  I still think setting skip-name-resolve and using IP addresses everywhere rather than zeroconf lookup will help. Slowness to connect with MySQL seems almost always related to resolving addresses. It has helped other users where Kodi access to db on NAS suddenly went slow url   '""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What remains is slowness opening db connection, it taking over 1s each time, that has become more persistent since you reset your server.  As Zeroconf setting makes no difference, and  no longer changes anything either I think we have to conclude that it is not anything that Kodi does that is  triggering such slow db opening connection. The MariaDB connector library used by v18 could be making a difference, but that library is external to Kodi.  >It is running on my DiskStation NAS. It has MariaDB 10.0.3 as well as 5. How to I get Kodi to use v10 and how do I migrate my databases from v5?  Sorry I have no personal experience of running MariaDB on a NAS dive so the guidence I can give is limited. I believe Synology has integrated docker support so I suppose the different MariaDB server versions you say are installed are in containers that are either listening on different IPs or different external ports.  You will have to pursue that yourself I\'m afraid.  All the Kodi guides on using  say to use IP address of the server in  e.g. , and I recommend that you do that rather than the shortcut .  Assign your NAS a fixed IP address and use that. Use of IP addresses avoids resolving names and is known to be quicker. This should be accompanied by adding to the  file, again as recommended.  Some notes here url  url  url Looking at other settings in   could be bigger if you have the memory. MariaDB recommend 80% of available in multiples of 1G. I will see if anyone else on the team has any other suggestions.  If you are thinking but it works for v17 and if it doesn\'t for v18 then that is a Kodi problem all I can remind you is that  server use for Kodi is an experiemental feature.  There are just too many server versions on too many platforms, all potentailly behave differently. It may have worked by accident, or the MariaDB connector library version change could have exposed an issue with your setup that was previously masked. The remaining slowness is happening on the MariaDB side of things," all I can suggest is that you move towards a more recommended configuration using IP addresses and that should help.

I confirmed it is not specific to the PVR by installing the official HDHomerun addon from the Kodi repository (Silicon Dust\'s video ).  It behaves exactly the same. As soon as I click outside of Kodi, the video will stop but audio continues until I click back into Kodi.  I confirmed that it does the same when streaming a stored MP4 video from the HD, so not isolated to the TV tuners, seems like all video is doing this.

Install Roosterteeth addon 2. Try to play a video from the RWBY series on the Roosterteeth addon 3. Notice that playback starts at the ~4-5 second mark  OR  1.

One thing I noticed is, that when I select a movie and hit refresh, it tells me that local information is there and will be overwritten by the one from the internet. Once I update, I see the poster. Then I closed Kodi, changed the  to some other, restarted and Kodi does not pick the new .  The problem seems to be:  So when Kodi should scan for local media, it prefers the data from the DB and here it should not matter wether I\'m using MySQL or SQLite. If I had to guess where to start I would choose url I\'m guessing it fails to check wether there is a  in the moviefolder and if so take this, compare with the cached Picture, update if nessescary, OR download poster from the internet etc ...  Another thing I noticed was, when I changed the scraper from MovieDB to Local only it updated all my movies, that had nfo files and it corrected the posters using the local files and inserted them into the DB. When I changed back from local to MovieDB it picked up a movie that had no nfo and a wrong (on purpose)  and this got added to the DB. Afterwards I deleted the wrong , cleaned the library and updated. My expected behaviour would have been, that Kodi recognizes, that the cached image is not valid any more (btw why cache it if you have a local resource with a  in the folder) since the base file does not exist," thus scans for a new one. But debig logs says skipping since there are no changes.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,

If I take the same file and change it in MKVToolNix to ENG video"," ENG audio and ENG forced sub without actually changing the files it works and forced subtitles are enabled by default like they should. ## Expected Behavior Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen: Matching language for audio and subtitles should be irrelevant as forced should mean forced no matter what language is set on the file as long as the subtitle is flagged as forced. ## Actual Behavior Only enables forced subtitles by default if audio and subtitle language matches. ## Possible Fix   ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. Take a file and change audio and subtitles language to different languages in MKVToolNix as well as flagging it as forced. 2. Take the same file but this time make another one with audio and subtitle language set to the same language. 3.

xbmc,15676,closed,24,2019-03-05 17:00:14,18.55,1,,,b'b\' Ok. Two things about this. First of all: my bad. I didn\\\'t realize that the number I ended up using was an order of magnitude smaller than the one I was using before.  Second thing is: ok," now I have set up a bigger number and SHIFT+CTRL O reports ""forward"" in the 700-900 MB range. But RAM usage keeps hovering around 350MB in Windows Task Manager. So I\\\'m not sure where the 768MB of cache I\\\'m seeing now reported are coming from. Are they real?  Also"," is there anything that could be done to allow for higher values of cache? 8/16GB machines are not so rare now (at least in Windows x64 environment).  Thanks for the help and sorry for the mishap. I was misled by the ""hyper"" readfactor value in the wiki and then I misread the new value I input for memsize (always change ONE thing at a time", I know...).  But RAM usage still tells a different story from the one Kodi is internally telling.  ![image]url  Edit: if I go to the Performance tab of Task Manager, under RAM, I see that RAM usage indeed raises by 1GB when playback starts," according to the ""forward"" value rasing till it hits the 1GB limit.  Sooo... well"," probably it\\\'s just due to the way this ""cache"" is handled internally"," that doesn\\\'t register as ""Kodi"" RAM usage", for some reason. Still it would be nice to be able to exceed 1GB effective cache, if one has the machine to do it. But it\\\'s more of a feature request, probably, to go along with the fact that Windows now has an x64 build. At least it led to the Wiki being corrected, so others won\\\'t be misled as how I was by that example. Maybe it would be good to clearly list the limits for the different values.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Furthermore I really don\\\'t see the point of having huge caches: you\\\'re either streaming from the internet with a little help from the cache to buffer glitches or you\\\'re playing something locally.

It is impossible to use Kodi for a prolonged period of time without encountering an out-of-memory condition which results in OOM killer restarting Kodi. The only addons I ever install and use are vdr-addon","  and oscam. This is not an addon issue. The easiest way for me to reproduce the issue is to tune to a high bitrate 4K TV channel and leave it playing for a few hours. During that time the memory usage of  process will progressively grow. Stopping the playback does not make it release the used RAM.  I tried to work around the issue by decreasing the MALLOC_MMAP_THRESHOLD value. I started with 131072 and went as low as 8192. It does not seem to make a huge difference  still grows and is eventually killed by OOM. ## Expected Behavior Here is a clear and concise description of what was expected to happen: I expect  RAM usage not to grow infinitely.  ### Debuglog The debuglog can be found here: url  ### Your Environment Used Operating system:  [ ] Android  [ ] iOS  [x] Linux  [ ] OSX  [ ] Raspberry-Pi  [ ] Windows  [ ] Windows UWP Operating system : LibreELEC  Kodi version: 18.2-rc1 current master  '""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have personally seen it on 18.1 and 18.2 (rc1).  It\\\'s been very difficult to catch in the act on a system where I could dig deeper.  If this is the same thing I\\\'ve seen I can add a couple pieces of information that I have.  First," when the EPG is shifted the program name displayed on the TV Home screen under ""Recently played channels"" will still be correct.  Second", restarting Kodi resolves the problem -clearing data does not fix it.  A simple  does it, even if no new EPG data is requested.  I speculate that it\\\'s a UI concern since the data in the Epg database is clearly correct.  Hopefully this helps, if not I apologize to @lama18 for interjecting an unrelated matter.

I will be digging into it a little and filing a separate Issue with the appropriate logs, but what causes this to happen for me is adding a channel while Kodi isn\\\'t running.  The EPG data for the new channel will be shown in the first channel\\\'s slot, and the remaining channel EPG data will be pushed to the next EPG slot," causing all the channels in the EPG UI to be wrong.  The data shown under ""Channels"" as well as the tiles on the home screen is accurate.  As I said", I will be opening my own issue with the logs and whatnot as I collect it.  I am going to step through some code first to see if I can narrow it down a bit for you first.

When it then reached the original loop point, it rewinds again. This keeps happening over and over again until I manually forward past the loop point.  This happens for almost all streams on those 2 TV channels, which releases new content every day.  ## Possible Fix The stream should just play normal. When I download the .m3u8 file with a program like: url  Then the downloaded video plays fine in mp4 format with Kodi.  ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  1. Open Kodi 2. Install the retrospect add-on from: url  3. Create an account at  4. Add your account to the  channel in the retrospect settings in Kodi. 5. Play a stream from  in Kodi.  A shorter way how the same issue is occuring is with playing the stream directly from Kodi. To do this: 1. Create a file with the extension .strm 2. Add the following URL to the file: url  3. Play the created .strm file with Kodi Please note that these videos are only available for +/7 days and might be geo-locked to Belgium. ### Debuglog The debuglog can be found here: url The log file  is about the stream started with the Retrospect plugin. The log file kodi-log2.log is about the stream started from a .strm file with .m3u8 URL inside. ### Screenshots  Here are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem:  As it is a video, a picture won\'t show anything. I will try to add a live video later. ## Additional context or screenshots (if appropriate) Here is some additional context or explanation that might help: This bugs affects me because I try to play Belgium TV channel streams (which are free), to my television. With this bug, I cant watch the stream in a relaxed way because it keeps looping over and over the same point. ### Your Environment Used Operating system: Dekstop computer and Nvidia shield  [x] Android  [ ] iOS  [ ] Linux  [ ] OSX  [ ] Raspberry-Pi  [x] Windows  [ ] Windows UWP Operating system : Windows 10, Android TV  Kodi version: Leia   *note: Once the issue is made we require you to update it with new information or Kodi versions should that be required.

The Configuration: PC ->HDMI->Denon AVR using Wasapi ->Denon AVR shows DTS-HD in 18", 18.1, 18.2 same configuration as above, same music file all is exactly the same, but Denon AVR shows DTS. VideoPlayer(DVDPlayer) in 17.6 and 18,18.2+18.2 is ok->Denon AVR shows DTS-HD.

AVR shows DTS-HD MA as it should be and thats very great and I\'m very happy.  So: i think (but I\'m no coder and maybe  i\'m wrong) if *.dtshd files were in that list above ( without using ) maybe mikdrop would work again. In 17.6 that happens in 18, 18.1, 18.2 only goes with *.dts and not with *.dtshd Files. Crossfading is, if i understand right what you have written, not possible thats a pitty. DTSHD Music Files are in blurays and you can rip them with hdstreamextractor if you only want the music and don\'t want a lot of GB with static pictures. So instead of 40 GB you have 3 or 4 GB music files. I think a lot of people would love that quality and would be happy if they could play it in Kodi with its skins," instead of a player like MPC-BE. MPC-BE also plays *.dtshd files but is a little poor in his skin and possibilities. But the most importand thing is: you have solved the *.dtshd problem for me and now i can use 18.2 and thats great.

But it would be somewhat useless if is not installed. So please install first:  after that reproduce your crash and at least attach the crashlog Kodi created there are more debugging options with gdb. After you have installed run it with:   after that you will get a prompt that will look like: and a cursor next to it. Enter on that. This will then start Kodi.

Obviously I failed", if someone can point me out where this is done I might be able to make and PR a fix myself. ### To Reproduce Steps to reproduce the behavior:  Go to settings->System->Settings->Display->Resolution ### Debuglog The debuglog can be found here: url  ### Screenshots  Here are some links or screenshots to help explain the problem:  ![screenshot000]url   ## Additional context or screenshots (if appropriate) Here is some additional context or explanation that might help:  ### Your Environment Used Operating system:  [ ] Android  [ ] iOS  [x] Linux  [ ] OSX  [ ] Raspberry-Pi  [ ] Windows  [ ] Windows UWP Operating system : own pet project,  amd ryzen 2400g linux 5.1.6 mesa 19.1.0-rc4  Kodi version: master @ url   *note: Once the issue is made we require you to update it with new information or Kodi versions should that be required.
