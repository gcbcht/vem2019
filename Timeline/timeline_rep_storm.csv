Can you elaborate on your concern with the supervisors taking on too much load? In the current approach, only nimbus acts as a seeder. The supervisors act as leechers and stop sharing as soon as they complete the download. The supervisors never seed. For the most part, the supervisors will prefer downloading parts from nimbus (since nimbus has the complete file)," and only share amongst themselves while downloading if a supervisor peer could offer a part with better performance than the nimbus peer. So the supervisors are ""download heavy"" and the nimbus\\\'s are ""upload heavy"". I\\\'ll move forward with including all topology files as part of the torrent download.

The Bittorrent based distribution greatly simplifies the construction of HA Nimbus (completely removes reliance on external systems)", and it is clearly the optimal approach for distributing static files around the cluster. So I\'d like us to figure out how to support our auth needs (or at least have a plan for it) within the context of a Bittorrent based approach. Perhaps this will require modifications to ttorrent, and that\'s fine. @ptgoetz So the reason for the importance of throttling is it provides a guarantee of load on a supervisor. First of all, I think supervisors should be allowed to seed files and participate in sharing after they\'ve finished downloading. This ensures jar distribution is fast and scalable to large clusters. But we need to make sure that the distribution process can only have a limited effect on active topologies \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\xc2\\xa0hence the throttling.

Are you willing to accept BitTorrent throttling (and auth) as separate pull requests? For those I will need to fork the ttorrent project and make the necessary modifications", which may take a while. IMHO, the switch to BitTorrent is a good first step toward HA, and the choking mechanism in the BitTorrent protocol will help alleviate overload on supervisors. When the BitTorrent feature is in place, the planned HA features can move forward. When throttling is available, it would be a simple addition (I could even put the hooks in place now). I can also add a configurable seed duration for supervisors (e.g. Don\'t seed, seed indefinitely," or seed for X seconds).""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

storm,629,open,12,2013-07-17 21:14:47,1098.9,,,1,b'b\' I dove into the ttorrent code last night and have a crude, but functional means of throttling throughput. Now I have a question and a caveat. The question is, do you want to throttle at the peer level, or the torrent level? I\\\'m assuming the torrent level so I\\\'m headed in that direction. The caveat is that the throttling is not exact," nor is the  of throuhput. So setting max  thresholds is more like a ""hint."" For example if I set a threshold of 50 .", the actual throughput will fluctuate between ~45-55 . but average very close to 50. The ttorrent logs will also report inaccurate throughputs. But testing with several bittorrent clients, throughput was very close to the requested threshold. Let me know if that\\\'s okay and I\\\'ll proceed. Thanks,Taylor\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If the easiest way to do that is to restrict the supervisor to downloading / sharing one torrent at a time", that could be an acceptable first step. And then we\\\'ll open up an issue to fix that. The trick if taking that implementation strategy is choosing which torrent that supervisor should share. We\\\'d also want to add a special case for when the supervisor has no active workers in which there would be no  limits.

The throttling in ttorrent works like so:A ttorrent client instance has exactly one torrent.The client can share () with _n_ peers (a _peer_ is just another client that participates in ). rate limits are set at the  level, the amount each peer is throttled will depend on how many peers are connected. For example, if you have a client sharing a torrent with 5 leeching (downloading) peers, and you set the max upload rate to 50 ., each downloading peer will only get 10 . If 4 of the 5 leechers stop downloading (or disconnect), the remaining downloading peer will be able to download at 50 . **How I see this playing out in storm:** (I\\\'m totally open to suggestions," etc.)Nimbus(\\\'s)/Supervisors will have separate global  rate limits (a limit <= 0.0 == unlimited).""Toplogy Torrents"" will contain: ", ,"  (let me know if I\\\'m missing anything).Each  will have 1 topology torrent for every deployed topology. (right now I\\\'m naming the file ""${storm-id}.torrent"")If a rate limit is set for ", the amount of bandwidth allocated to each  will depend on the number of deployed topologies. For example, if I set and there are two  topologies deployed, the 50 . bandwidth will be split between the two (25  each). Killing one of the two toplogies will rebalance the bandwidth allocation, so the remaining toplogy will then get the full 50 . Seeding:By default, Nimbus will seed a topology torrent until the topology is killed.Supervisors can be configured with: download-only, seed-for-duration, seed-indefinitely Is that an acceptable feature set for this pull request? I\\\'d like to nail down those features and move on to sorting the ramifications it will have on  , et. al. There\\\'s some logic in there that I have yet to fully grok (sync, download cleanup, etc.), and I may need to lean on you for some  to make sure everything\\\'s right.  I\\\'m still in a WIP state at this point, but largely functional.
