Activity on these links sometimes goes in cycles if a post is RTd later. To get the age of the link, it seems fine to get the date from the associated post. (The same link could be associated w/ multiple posts but that\'s okay in this context). In terms of tracking the  links: because we want to do periodic checks, it could make sense to keep bookkeeping as plugin \'instance\'  data, similar to the data in the tu_instances_twitter table.  This lets us work progressively from oldest to newest candidate link, doing a configurable chunk of work each crawler run from where we left off last time, and then cycle back to recheck starting with the links from e.g. a month previous to the current date.

With this information we could do something like the following.Each time the crawler runs, do two things:process N1 of the links [those with no ], oldest first, also expanding them as necessary. For this part, we don\'t need to keep any instance information as long as we work up through the links chronologically.recheck N2 of the already-processed bitly links as follows.  Each time the crawler runs, first see if the \'cursor\' value is 0.  If it is, test the \'finished_checking\' date. If it is < 6 hours ago (or some reasonable configurable value), just exit.  This prevents constant rechecking, which is probably not necessary.  If the cursor == 0 and \'finished_checking\' is Then fetch N2 links with date >= the cursor date.  After processing the N2 items, set the cursor to the date where we left off.  When we run out of items," set the cursor = 0 and \'finished_checking\' to the current time.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To pass the responsibility to the installer instead of addressing the issue properly by reducing the filename length is may i say poor. Also, I am not even talking about the install stage," simply cloning the repo to a folder greater than 16 chars is all that is required to raise this issue. Does...""application_rate_limit_-resources=account",statuses,users,followers,lists,friends,favorites,friendships,"application"" and...""application_rate_limit_-resources=account",statuses,users,followers,lists,friends,favorites,friendships,application,"search"" really add value as file names on any OS? The longest name here is 133 chars", leaving 16 to win, how about renaming it to 16 so win has 133 chars? Perhaps, i\\\'m missing something, is the resistance to rename due to the file name (and this would be shocking) being used as parameters to a function. Please reconsider, much preferable are shorter meaningful file names that can be neatly organized in sub folders rather than the ancient 1990s practice of things requiring to be placed at drive root (as per the docs suggestion) yuk!

The filenames look odd because they map simply and clearly to URLs with specific parameters defined by third-party APIs", in this case Twitter\'s. Shortening them would add yet another level of mapping that developers would have to decode while they write tests. My job is to make writing tests easier, not more difficult, hence the more  filenames. The files lengths are well within Windows\' 256-character limit. We\'re not asking devs to store the files at the root," just within a 16-character folder name. I realize that is short.

How about initializing InsightTerms with the network parameter in InsightPluginParent itself? And instead of having methods, we treat InsightTerms as just a data structure. The constructor can load all the member variables according to the given network parameter. Or we can also instantiate insight_terms of anonymous type within InsightPluginParent with getInsightTerms(). Since insight terms are only intrinsic to insights, should we really create a whole class for it? Don\'t you think InsightPluginParent should encapsulate this data internally?For testing, we can create a TestOfInsightPluginParent.""'
ThinkUp	1622	closed	9	ginatrapani	2013-05-28 18:31:28	341.9		+1		b'b\' This is similar to how gettext() works, a localization library for PHP. In a way, this is a kind of network localization.Sure, we can do that. So in InsightPluginParent::__construct, we could have a $this->terms = new InsightTerms($instance->network). But we\\\'d still have an InsightTerms object in that case.Do you mean that InsightPluginParent would have member variables, like $post_term, $liked_term, $published_term? We could initialize those either using an InsightsTerm object, or a private associative array inside the InsightPluginParent class. I\\\'m advocating for the separate class for modularity\\\'s sake. I thought you were suggesting we have a giant public associative array, which would require the internal insight code (or at least the InsightParentPlugin constructor) to have intimate knowledge of the structure of this array to access the terms.  Best practices for good OOP design generally suggest creating getter methods which abstract away data structures internally, so that we could make changes to it later without having to refactor the calling code. (And there will be  soon, for YouTube.) It sounds like the question is do we put this  logic in the InsightPluginParent or in a new InsightTerms class. I like to keep classes small, specific, and make them do ""one thing well", so I tend toward creating new classes for small jobs like this. It makes for cleaner, more modular, code where each classes\\\' job is apparent. This is a good . We could go either way, but ultimately I think a separate class is the best OOP code design.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And this data could be loaded into $this->terms.You\'re right! Reading this", I just realized that insight terms are in no way a sub-property of InsightPluginParent. So it makes more sense to have a separate class that well defines its functionality. In terms of abstraction, we\'re making it available to the insight through $this->terms in any case. One more thing, does it make more sense to have member methods like getNoun(\'post\'), getNoun(\'like\'), getVerb(\'posted\')," getVerb(\'liked\') which could then return the data directly or call private functions like getPostTerm() etc. This way it is more intuitive for the developer to build the insight language.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ThinkUp,1704,closed,2,2013-08-26 18:39:48,434.98,,1,,b'b\' Hi Aaron, This commit combines different changes into one diff: the InsightTerms modifications, and the insight. When you can, separate discrete changes like this into separate commits for easier review. The insight needs some work, but @nilakshdas needs the InsightTerms changes to proceed with his development, so I broke out the InsightTerms modifications and reviewed those first. I made some changes to your implementation and wanted to explain them here: First, I combined getMultiplierAdverb and getMultiplierDecreaseAdverb. I didn\\\'t see any reason why those couldn\\\'t be the same function. The advantage of combining them is that it decreases the number of possible valid values for $type from 3 to 2 (no more \\\'multiplier-decrease\\\'). Then I noticed that $number could be a string (for getOccurrencesAdverb) or an int the rest of the time, which doesn\\\'t make sense. All of these functions convert a number to a term, so they should all only accept ints. So I modified getOccurrencesAdverb to accept ints only. Then we were down to 3 function, one public function getNumberTerm which took a parameter $type to route the logic to one of two private functions. This didn\\\'t make sense to me. So I deleted the public function and simply made the two private functions public. This way the call to the function only takes 1 parameter (not 2, including type), it\\\'s always an int, and it\\\'s clear what you\\\'re going to get back based on the function name.  This reduces the possibility that a programmer would pass in an irrelevant value for $type," like ""occurrence."" This reduced code and enforced a tighter contract between functions. (More on Design by Contract: url  I made the changes to the tests", and committed this in cc06e9dd954e24aca4ec3533823bb8bd6b81027f This change will require changes to how you call these functions in this insight. I\\\'ll review that separately.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
