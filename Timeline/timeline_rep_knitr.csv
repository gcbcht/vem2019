knitr,39,closed,5,2011-12-07 12:04:18,962.03,,1,,b'b\' Thanks for the clarification Yihui. I do acknowledge that knitr approach to child document is much more flexible, allowing for a finer control on the includes.The code chunks for child inclusion are also nice (recent dev or I missed them on first read?). Are options passed to the child chunk used as global options when knitting the child document? This would be really nice. However, my view would still be to support \\\\SweaveInput tags, for convenience for old Sweave users. Note that I never used it since it is not documented (is it?), so it is not a personal matter. And just to make my general opinion clear: knitr really rocks. But generally speaking, I think that the more tolerant a tool is on its input format, the more easily people switch to it, e.g. LibreOffice  MS Word documents although LibreOffice\\\'s developers might not like its format, Octave is -manly -compatible with Matlab language, my dog eats my cat\\\'s food, etc...Besides, as you say your self it is easy to implement the support, which will all be at knitr\\\'s advantage.Another point is that users switching to knitr now might encounter some issues, since it still is in alpha, and might have to temporally switch back to Sweave, for the time knitr gets its way to stable, which I am sure will happen soon. If finer control is desired, then the user can (must) always switch to the child chunks or knit_child command," which _are_ very nice.In brief a feature line for knitr could be: ""\\\\SweaveInput tags are supported", although they are ugly and against knitr philosophy," but much better things can be done with child chunks and  "". I know I am stubborn", but I tend to think that things that can be automatised, should not be left to the user, that might not be as advanced as one might  and run away if any error occurs.

It is not so elegant indeed.(Sweave with cacheSweave don\'t bother about duplicate names at all. In their logging they just give the original name", i.e. you have to figure out yourself which of the duplicately named blocks it is. Would be fine with me for knitr too that case the inelegant naming could be kept internal). I thought of giving each block its own counter, instead of using the chunk count. This would work for multiple calls of a child document. E.g. in the Stackoverflow post that triggered this discussion, the number would simply be the times the chunk is executed, which is more intuitive than the chunk count. If the blocks in the child document were to have duplicate names, however, the resulting table names would be a mess once again. BTW: With this pull request I shortly feared for cache filename problems with repeated chunks, but that is not a problem, the cache files also neatly have the chunk count in them. Ah, I just thought of another way. Chunks in child documents could get a compound label: name_of_parent_. That way you could forbid duplicate chunk names again, and deal with multiple calls of a child document. Oh wait, this does not work for inline knit_child() calls, nor for multiple knit_child() calls from one block.

Everything has worked out and I\'ve set up cloning someone else\'s jekyll files and simply switching my information in for theirs. The problem is I don\'t know how to add new posts. I tried it a couple different ways. First", via Rstudio I simply opened up a new markdown file in my project environment and saved that .Rmd file to my _source folder right next to the .Rmd file that was included in the repo I had cloned. When I do this, there are no changes that I am able to commit and I don\'t see the new file in the in my Rstudio Files pane -even though its in there when I look it up via Finder (I\'m using a Mac). So how do I activate this .Rmd file or incorporate it into the project. All i want to do is produce new posts! Seems very silly that its as complicated as it is (spent a couple hours trying to figure out this one simple task to no avail). By the way, I also tried physically moving a new copy to that _source folder (instead of saving it in there) and still no changes to my repo. I restarted my computer 3-4 times.

knitr,1669,closed,body,2019-02-06 21:36:56,00:00,1,,,b'b\' I have asked this question in [stackoverflow]url  too but did not get an answer yet.  The gist of it is, within a freshly created blogdown page," creating a table using causes the caption to be edited to include a reference link and a table count (eg. ""Table 1: Intended Caption""). This is undesirable for me but I assume it is intended behaviour.  However this behaviour changes when is called from within pretty much anything that uses a  . The reference link is added by appending a in the beginning of each table which html just shows as plain text.  Here is an an example post that highlights the problem. Here  \\\'s caption is processed correctly but all the others use the format.     title: test   author: \\\'\\\'   date: \\\'2019-02-05\\\'   slug: test   categories: []   tags: []                 As stated on the stackoverflow I was able to identify the code that causes this behaviour in the function but could not understand how """" is set or can be modified.  Ultimately", I don\\\'t want my captions to be edited by kintr at all. But the second behaviour is clearly wrong and unintentional while the first is probably a sensible default (though I would appreciate some hints in getting rid of that too).\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If I replace that with  ", I get the same malformed table caption. This suggests the issue has nothing to do with  s. I suspect in blogdown and bookdown," knitr outputs the files with the malformed captions which are later processed by something else to add the table numbers.
