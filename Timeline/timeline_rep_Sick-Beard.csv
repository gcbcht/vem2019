The code is written so that it will try the HTTP API first, then go to JSON if the HTTP API fails.  This way, people that aren\'t on XBMC nightlies will continue to use the same code they always have. There was one tweak I made that affected the HTTP API code... The XBMC Test Notification code didn\'t return a  like the rest of the notiifiers; it returned the http that came back, and then the calling code parsed it out.  I just moved the parsing of the return string into the notifier code so it could return , and updated  to expect a  out of it. In doing all this, I did find a bug in the development code of XBMC that actually makes this somewhat useless at the moment... url  which led to url  ... Until they get this bug resolved, you still need to run the auto-clean.  Oh well, not much I can do about that. All I can say is that the JSON code works on the ubuntu nightly ppa XBMC.

Sick-Beard,517,closed,3,2012-10-28 20:49:45,747.7,1,,,b'b\' FYI, there are a couple of annoyances in my code.. Those of us on bleeding edge (ie, we need the JSON interface) get double hits to XBMC (first hit for HTTP API, which fails, then the JSON calls).  On a local network," I pretty much thought ""eh"," who cares""", but it does show up in the XBMC debug logs as a hit to the http server.  I always pictured that once the official release of XBMC goes out with the HTTP API pulled, the order of functions would get reversed so that JSON is attempted first, and then down the line, the HTTP functions would get removed entirely. Due to that double hit, some extra logging happens in SickBeard due to the HTTP API library update function throwing off a  message in the event of a failure.  It\\\'s something I had meant to refactor a little bit (moving the Error logging up to the externally called function), but just plain forgot about.\''

I tried again in master but it seems the tests are broken at the moment. If I had my way", I would use HTTPretty url  to test this change with an integration test. That would add quite a bit of coverage for existing Sick-Beard code because it would use all the existing code and only override the call to thetvdb at the socket level. It would still be quick and deterministic since we would be defining the return value for the call and it wouldn\'t actually use the network. I\'ve done similar tests at my job and I am currently working on a test suite for the Paython library that uses this method. The only reason I didn\'t go crazy and write that test was because I wasn\'t sure if my PR would be rejected for doing so and I didn\'t want to do all that work for nothing. If you gave me the go-ahead," I would work on an integration test suite for the tvdb calls in Sick-Beard using HTTPretty. I\'d also be happy to take a crack at fixing the existing tests so that we could set up some CI for this awesome project. Let me know what you think. Thanks!""'",,,,,,,,,,
