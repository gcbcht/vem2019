MaNGOS,121,closed,body,2013-02-06 09:55:44,00:00,1,,,b'b\' Hi everyone, I want to address a few questions and fact in this topic, since github is public to everyone," not only to the users of  or other forums First I want to say that this is mainly addressed to @Salja (and @TheLuda if he\\\'s still around) the actual administrator of the so called ""mangos foundation"".I\\\'d like to discuss this openly", no swears or personal injuries. Also I\\\'m not here to discuss legal issues (the ones posted here: url  ) regarding our projects. This is something which lawyers can handle. First, I understood by reading your forum, that cMangos is bad, probably the worst thing in the universe at this moment. And because of this, cMangos must be boycotted, closed, banned and it\\\'s developers burned alive in public. Considering this, then why did you just copy paste all our commits into the mangos repositories? I know that the open source policy allows it, and I\\\'m not complaining about this, but I\\\'m complaining about the morality of this thing.Why don\\\'t you just wipe all the cMangos commits, from every repository, every hard drive and just start from url  and do the research and code writing by yourself?If cMangos is it that bad," why did you copy paste our commits? Wouldn\\\'t this be called a ""plagiarism""?If cMangos project was taken down"," shouldn\\\'t you do the same with all the commits that belonged to cMangos?Don\\\'t you think that you will also violate the so called ""copyrights"" if you just take our commits and then put your copyright headers on the files to which you had no contribution at all in the past 6 months?If you really think that cMangos was blocking you way to evolve"," to be ""the best of the best""", then you should know that the are many other projects which are far more evolved and popular than your current mangos," and virtually almost nobody cares what happens to the your ""mangos foundation"". Mangos has no more than 1% ""market share"" compared to TrinityCore and Skyfire.Finally don\\\'t you realize that all the fellow projects (scripts and database) won\\\'t support your core anymore? Don\\\'t you realize that the mangos core is virtually a piece of dead code without database and scripts? As a conclusion: if you really want cMangos banned", then so be it. But then you will have to drop all our commit from your repositories and restore them to the original commit, before cMangos was born. After this the mangos project can progress (or maybe rest) in peace. Thanks in advance, Xfurry PS.If you really have balls in you pants, you will answer to this topic, like a man, and not just delete it and run away crying like a baby. ;)\''

Leaving the project and forking it, still means you have to keep the original copyrights.2nd) the mangos foundation actually was registered a few years ago, and still is, and I am the one paying the bills for mangos for almost 8 years now. There is a real, legal organisation, although we are exempted from taxes, since the foundation does not have any income, or follows any business purpose, except to benefit newly developers studying. Also, I submit regular tax sheets every year, but there usually is nothing going, because donations are hardly there except for a sum below $50 or even $0 over a year. But besides that, the point here is just plain simple:Some people left mangos, and that is perfectly fine. But if you leave a project, you have no right to claim the copyright. Just like MariaDB is a fork which kept the original copyright from MySQL in their source, anyone forking mangos is simply obliged to keep the copyright. E.g. the original mangos core contains code by me, which I licensed under GPL v2 to the mangos project. Did you ask my permission to re-licence that for cmangos? Nope. I am sorry, but you can have cmangos, and do what you want, but you have to follow the license terms, and that is not up for discussion. The GPL is a valid license, and I can not see any value in cmangos, if the fork which it is does not intend to respect even a simple license. For me, I don\'t care.

MaNGOS,121,closed,9,2013-02-06 09:55:44,75.5,1,,,b'b\' About legal matters. I stated my opinion about these weeks ago in the relevant discussion. Nobody had anything to say about my arguments.I won\\\'t waste my time to repeat myself however. @theLuda I know you are unable to read, but there never was any illigal re-licensing done by our side.The code is still GPLv2 as it should and must be.Besides you should not overestimate your own contribution," from my history the last none-trivial commit done by yourself was in 2008. So all you have any ""moral"" rights to claim is something like readding a ""copyright-line"" up till 2008.\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
