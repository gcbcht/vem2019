I remember i tracked down the problem (but never got it fixed)", but I can\'t remember exactly what it was. I _thought_ it had something to do with me setting up the container via DI, thus it would set the max hops every time the container was pulled for every request, thus constantly resetting the hop count so it was always 0 and never incremented to 1. However, it might actually be a more fundamental bug with the Container and how it counts the hops, I don\'t remember. I ended up using FlashMessenger, because instead of using max hops, it simply unsets messages as they are pulled from the container (we could just duplicate this logic in the PRG plugin as a work-around, but why bother if that\'s pretty much exactly what FlashMessenger does?).

After that, a single variable argument  .  An optional argument (or its shorthand  )  An optional argument.  An optional argumentWhen a console route matches it will behave analogical to an http route trying to dispatch the request with an action controller, obtained from _Service Manager_.Action controller can handle a request in several ways:  1. It can directly retrieve a from Service Manager it allows reading from and writing to console window, bypassing the MVC layer and enabling interactivity with the user. 2. It can return a instance that will be shown in console window  3. It can return a that will be show in console window.## Standard console request flow1. We are assuming zf2 application is run in a console window.2. The entry point could be any php script. A standard []url  will work just fine.3. **Zend\\\\Application::init()** **Zend\\\\Application::boostrap()** 1. creates and returns   2. creates and returns   3. by default loads parameters from and environment information from  . 4. creates and returns with configuration loaded from   5. creates and returns  4.  **Zend\\\\Application::run()** 1. **$events->trigger(MvcEvent::EVENT_ROUTE ... ) routing phase**  1. is routed  2. User-supplied command-line arguments are matched against defined routes.   3. The first route that matches, wins.  4. Matching parameters are stored in objects. 2. **$events->trigger(MvcEvent::EVENT_DISPATCH ... ) dispatching phase**  1. In case any route matches, an action controller is loaded and invoked.  2. If the action returns a  : will transform the string into a object.  3. If the action returns the response will immediately be shown in console window.  4. If the action returns it will not be transformed. 3. **$events->trigger(MvcEvent::EVENT_RENDER, $event) rendering phase**  1. NOTE: Current version does not perform any form of  on the result coming from action controller. There is no support for templating or markup. This is planned and will be discussed soon.  2. If the resulting contains children (i.e. several actions provided some text), results will be concatenated.  3. transforms into  . 4. **$events->trigger(MvcEvent::EVENT_FINISH, $event); output phase**  1. invokes   2. Result is echoed to console window  3.  .## Route not found flow In case no arguments have been provided  no console route matched user-provided arguments, the following will happen:1. _[no changes up to here]_2.  **Zend\\\\Application::run()** 1. **$events->trigger(MvcEvent::EVENT_ROUTE ... ) routing phase**  1. is routed  2.

Create a _console banner_:   1. Go through all     2. For all modules that implement call method that is expected to return a string.   3. All banners are joined together with a newline  .   4. In case there are no banners    4. Create _console usage information_:   1. Go through all     2. For all modules that implement call method that is expected to return a string or array   3. If an array is returned, its elements are analyzed. Subarrays are treated as  with descriptions, strings are used as they are.   4. Lists of parameters are automatically formatted, aligned in columns that fit inside current console window.  5. Banner and usage info is concatenated and injected into console view model.3. _[no changes from here]_## Possible BC breaks### Introduction of Mvc\\\\View\\\\SendResponseListener This deprecates the following invocation method used in ZendSkeleton: In favor of  The entry point, init script (i.e.  ) should not decide if the response should be sent or not. The ability to martial response sending or not-sending should be in the hands of developers, module authors. It must be delegated to mvc listeners. Furthermore, method is not a standard response interface method and might not be implemented by all response subclasses. More detailed explanation in the following commit message: url  has been introduced to fix this. It is attached by to and will invoke method on response object, if possible.### Refactor of Mvc\\\\View namespace All Http-related classes have been moved to namespace. This might break some modules or custom listeners that were subclassing them. This change _does NOT break_ SM aliases. The following SM aliases are still valid:      NOTE: Those aliases will point to classes relevant to current environment. For example, in http requests will point to an instance of  ," while in console requests it will be The following new aliases have been created for clarity:    '""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The component is loosely-based on [Python Unidecoder]url  and the transliteration is based on a database in form of conversion tables. I want UniDecoder to find it\'s way into ZF 2.0.0 because I need it for Console transliteration in case the console is non-utf8 compatible and the Application tries to output multibyte strings. Without transliteration, the whole output will become unreadable and certain special characters can modify remote session settings, clear the screen or throw cursor around the screen. ### Basic usage The class is a static class," similar to and offers a single method.

zendframework,2131,closed,7,2012-08-08 13:35:19,757.07,1,,,b'b\' The commit was born out of following problem: Object A is a Doctrine entity with a 1:1 relation to object B. An instance of A is stored in the database, but has no related instance of B yet.We generated a form for this with a Form for A and a Fieldset for B.Since it is necessary to provide an object for the form as well as for the fieldset, we initially provided new instances for A and B during the form generation process. After querying the database for an instance of A Form::bind() is used to bind the instance of A to the form and overwrites the initially set A in the from. This works quite well, until you want to store them, because B was never added to Doctrines Unit of Work which is needed to persist it. (Result: B was never stored)  So we tried to add B to the Unit of Work during the generation process. This is working for the initially described use case when an instance of A is provided but the related B instance is not existing yet. If A has a related B instance, we get this instance already managed by the Unit of Work. (Result: B is stored twice) So we need to remove the initially added B instance from the Unit of Work if a new object is set in the Fieldset. (btw: This gets even more complex if you want to use inherited objects) We\\\'re finally came up with a better solution (overwriting Form::bindValues()) but this was an use case in which setObject() was needed. But I like to share my experiences during the work on this and provide some proposals for better extensibility:1. The FieldsetInterface describes a form representation of one entity while the Collection is used for multiple entities. But since there is no CollectionInterface, you have to rely on the Collection class (including the functionality) if you want to implement a form element which is used for more than one object. 2. The Fieldset provides a setter for the object," which cannot be used with the Collection class because the function is (implicit) typed to object and you can\\\'t pass an array as parameter. It seems that this has lead to the ""hack"" implementation in Fieldset (Line 576 583) where the setter is explicitely not used. Instead Collection should override the setObject() method and accept arrays. (This commit does not include this)3. According to 2. the setter should always be used to set the object to allow custom logic at this point. It\\\'s hard to describe a common use case for this", but it should be generally possible (see our initial problem above)4. The check if an object can be set in a fieldset ($fieldset->object && $object instanceof $fieldset->object) should be handled by the fieldset itself. Like $fieldset->acceptObject($object). So the Fieldset class does not have to know the implementation details of the concrete fieldset. Currently we need to know that Collection behaves different than the Fieldset and an additional OR is needed to check if the $object is valid.  \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zendframework,2318,closed,body,2012-09-09 13:17:29,00:00,,1,,b'b\' This PR adds an option to CurrencyFormat view helper to remove the two decimals number (I often need to simply prints the integer number). HOWEVER it looks like NumberFormatter has a bug (I tried to read the unit tests of PHP and none of them covered the case, and I have not been able to find any help anywhere on the Internet). The problem is that depending on the locale, it does not remove the decimals digits. This option sets the NumberFormatter::FRACTION_DIGITS attribute to 0, which should remove the decimals. For instance," when setting the locale to ""en_US""", this $numberFormatter->formatCurrency(\\\'45\\\'," \\\'USD\\\') prints ""$45"". However", when keeping the same locale (en-US) but chaning the currency to \\\'EUR\\\'," it prints ""\\xe2\\x82\\xac45.00"". At the same time"," if I change the locale to ""fr-FR"""," and prints a number with currency ""EUR""", it prints 45 \\xe2\\x82\\xac, and thus removing the decimals. I\\\'ve tried the money_format function of PHP and it does not suffer from this problem. So it really looks like Intl implementation is buggy, but at the same time, it works with some locales, and for other locales, it just does nothing. So we may merge (or not ?). If anyone have some thoughts about it... (side note : rounding the number before formatting does nothing).\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

zendframework,2865,closed,1,2012-10-30 12:02:00,1201.47,,1,,b'b\' @coolmic for both your problems there are good alternatives. First," usually you have translations for all your locales. It is a good practice to write all message ""to-be-translated"" as English sentences", but you translate these at all times, nevertheless of the default locale. There is no need to check if the language is English and then omit the translation. Translators also give usually the key back as translation when it does not exist. So if you want to translate \\\'hello\\\', you have a French translation \\\'hello\\\' =The second problem: it is in most cases easier to translate the labels directly in the form class itself. Your form looks something like this: Every label is translated inside the form, so you can make your form view very simple: If you match two forms you get form two different modules (and thus, two different text domains), you have no trouble in doing so. \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The solution given by @devosc works, but I would have to modify in a lot of places where I call session_start(). So I figured  out another way to do it, and I back here to share this solution. (I don\\\'t know if it\\\'s the best solution)Just to explain my problem: I have two domains, like  and . Both of them share the same session, but only the  are using ZF2, while the  uses pure PHP. To share the session between the two domains I used the @devosc\\\'s solution," with the session_domain like """".But now comes the different part of the problem. On the ", I have the , where use a different session. I know, this is not a fashion design, but that the way the system are when I get it, and for a while this will not change. So, in admin folder, there is a lot of files using session_start(). So when I access the , and logon, the session on both  and  is destroyed, causing the exception described above. If I replace every session_start for the zf2 autoloader, then good times, but don\\\'t make sense, because I not need to share the session inside the admin. So," what I did was just set a name for the session on a .htaccess file inside the admin folder using ""php_value """, and everything works fine with no conflict.I\\\'m just posting this here for someone that are facing the same problem, or maybe this can fit in another problem like this. I hope some feedback for the case this is not a good way to solve it.Thanks! \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,

It\'s not unlikely that a developer will want to use the factories outside of the MVC system. If we have the factories in  , the developer then either had to add that component as a dependency, or write their own factories. This makes a great argument for having the factories in either the components or in  . My inclination is to make them part of the components:The factories serve as some documentation as to how to instantiate a component  classes in the component, particularly in how to wire up dependencies.While the factories are defined by the component, they could potentially be consumed by another service locator  IoC system easily.Because you do not _need_ to use the factories, the dependency on is an optional one.

The idea is to be able to build [delegates]url  of any existing service. This can be used to build ""decorators"" for service instantiation and for proxying.#### Delegation Imagine that you have a and a object. A wraps around a ""real"" instance like following", but provides additional API that sends queries to a logger: Currently," our problem is that such a wrapper requires us to completely re-define the factory that instantiates  . There\\\'s no way to re-use logic from such a factory. We have to rewrite it and be aware of its internal logic:  #### Proxying We can proxy any service (with the assumption that we know its class name or implemented interface) and make it ""lazy""", so that its dependencies don\\\'t get instantiated when we request them. This allows us to build lightweight containers, as explained in url  Also, we don\\\'t have to worry about how the original service is instantiated, since the original factory is still existing.## Example In the following example, I\\\'ve simply replaced the original service (instance of  ) with a new one that contains the original service in property  :  ## Implementation flawsAdditional method call to  , since I splitted to allow this kind of behavioris public, since I cannot use a closure and call in PHP 5.3It may not be clear at first, but the delegate factory is a service (which is a huge advantage, but is a bit different from what we\\\'re used to see)## Documentation A documentation PR has been provided at -documentation#825\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

More problematic than expected:can return any of: a instance, a formatted  string, or a timestamp.As a form element, the likelihood of having a instance present is next to nil.The only filter related to  values is  , which will cast the value to a string, based on the format registered with it. About the only way I see this working at this point is if you do one of the following:Right now," if you specify a format for the element of ""u"" or ""U""", and also add a DateTimeFormatter filter for the element that uses that format," the current validators should ""just work"," as they will be comparing integer strings.As for a future fix, we could add the DateTimeFormatter filter by default to the input specification, using the same format string as is registered with the element. This would attempt to munge the value into a formatted  string. This would only work for comparison purposes if using the ""u"" or ""U"" formats, however.Alternately, we could add Form-specific validators that would cast the values to DateTime instances before doing the necessary  ,  , and step validations, but ultimately leave the value of the input untouched. This seems more tricky, but probably more correct. Eventually, we will want to make GreaterThan and LessThan work with DateTime and other built-ins. However, I think the crux of the problem, as reported here, has more to do with the DateTime form element, and requires a different approach, as outlined above. @maxnuf @localheinz @ThaDafinser @DASPRiD -thoughts?\''

This one is another lower-level component, but I need this one to correctly finish the InputFilter one. As for filter, the main changes will be: some performance optimizations we can make with PHP 5.4, cleaning some code, homogenize options by using underscore_separated... The only real change I\'ve made for now is to make the ValidatorChain exactly the same as FilterChain (I was always bothered that those classes didn\'t have the same method names or underlying implementation). HOWEVER, there is a change @ocramius and I discussed on IRC and I\'d love to have your opinion on that. The InputFilter refactor made the component completely stateless. It opened interesting optimizations, and the idea came to make validators also stateless. To stay simple, the following code: Will be transformed to: As for input filters," validationResult instances are serializable and can be transformed to JSON. Translation would still be handled by the validators themselves: they will translate the error messages and pass them to the validation result. What do you think of this idea?

There are multiple things I\\\'ve made that we need to talk about.First, the AbstractValidator is now very lightweight compared to [previously]url  It has no reference to any Translator," no data to store. I\\\'ve also removed the static ""minimumLength"" variable because I think it\\\'s the job of a view helper to cut a message.Validators are completely decoupled from translation layer.All variables were changed from camelCased to underscore_separated as it is by convention.Please note the ""setOptions"" thing. This pattern goes beyond the Validator class. A LOT of classes inside a framework needs that kind of thing (an option array). I think that we can make it really convenient in ZF3 by writing a trait (like my previous PR @weierophinney :)) that could be used in all those classes. Of course", this trait would make some assumptions : that keys are underscore_separated, and that the setter of the corresponding property is called to set the value (this thing should propably take into account isser and has, until we have real property accessors in PHP :(). Of course, custom needs can avoid the use of the trait," but I think that would be a convenient pattern if we really follow the same covnentions accross the framework. We could even write an interface like ""OptionsCapableInterface", that a factory could check and inject options.The validator classes are no longer responsible to create error messages. They just create a ValidationResult object with error messages, data and optional variables that can be injected inside the message.The Validation error have three main methods: isValid, getRawErrorMessages and getErrorMessages. When getErrorMessages is called, variables are being replaced using a preg_replace. The getRawErrorMessages can be used by for translation. For instance, as @Ocramius said, we could create, in the translation component, a kind of decorator: Or, if we want to keep it simple, the dependency to i18n could be moved to the ValidationResult (which is probably better, as some people may be angry if we introduce anothr abstraction level).

Essentially, we have an order-of-operations issue, and I don\\\'t see a way we can resolve it. When you add an input to the input filter that already exists, the method grabs the original, and calls using the input that was passed in. In the case of your test, you\\\'re doing the following:Adding a element, which is itself an  .Creating a instance with an instance corresponding to the defined, and attaching it directly to the form.Implicitly calling via  , which fetches the explicitly attached instance, iterates through all elements, and then adds inputs when any are instances. This in turn invokes the operation defined above, as it is trying to add the input specification from the element to the already existing you explicitly created. If we set the flag, what happens is that never attempts to merge in the element\\\'s input specification. The problem that now exists is that we decided with #4996 that the expected merge order should be to merge new elements into old ones. This is intuitive and expected -what we had before was not. However, due to how forms work, the order of operations becomes more dicey -if you set the element first, and then add an input filter," which one is the ""new"" instance? That said: I would _expect_ that explicitly adding the input filter instance will be problematic", knowing the merge order is from new into old, and knowing that the input specifications are merged when the input filter is retrieved. To confirm my suspicions, I tried altering the patch to not explicitly add the input filter: This worked perfectly. Alternately, this also worked: My point is: instead of adding an explicit input filter instance, could you define a fieldset  form as an  , instead? This would preserve the merge operations, as the input filter would be created on first access instead, and input filters take precedence over individual inputs.  At this point, I don\\\'t think there\\\'s any way we can accommodate the assumptions of this test explicitly, regardless of whether or not you see it as a BC break; the change made in #4996 was definitely correct to make; the previous behavior was unfortunately a side effect of broken behavior.\'',,,,,,,,,

I can have a few storage instances, however I\\\'ll have thousands of items stored, many of which will have custom-set ttl.I dislike this idea.  This means multiple network connections (i.e. memcache), multiple cache directories (filesystem) or multiple open databases (dba and similar). Moreover, some storages can\\\'t work in the same space i.e. setting the same for storage will produce strange errors ... event if namespaces are different (probably namespacing is broken or it just doesn\\\'t work this way and requires separate directories).  This doesn\\\'t solve many use cases I want to have continuous control over TTL. I don\\\'t want 10 groups in 10s intervals, I want to be able to precisely control the TTL as it\\\'s important for my app. i.e. time-related models should be stored only for specific X seconds, or when implementing a full-page caching, I want the page to expire at very specific moment in the future. A catch-all bag, container, with fixed TTL won\\\'t cut it and if I end up having 20 cache containers and still not solving the problem then something doesn\\\'t look right...Different adapters offer different capabilities. Some problems can be shimmed," some should just be ignored (i.e. it\\\'s a platform limitation). I\\\'ve seen that DBA adapter and TTL is not supported at all (before my PR). I haven\\\'t really implemented anything there yet as I\\\'m wondering if it\\\'s worth the work. Not sure if DBA is that popular (esp. as it\\\'s a pain to  it with PHP)I know it tests the ""global catch-all storage-wise"" TTL which is useless to me. I\\\'ve added a few tests for the new per-item TTL functionality.I\\\'ve described it in motivation. TTL is the single most important option and is implemented **natively** in almost all PHP extensions related with caching.  As a metaphor please recall Zend_Cache from ZF1. The signature for included ttl and even tags. Only a few adapters supported tags so we might argue", that it\\\'s not something worth pursuing. TTL param, on the other hand, is common among built-in caching functions and in other libraries.  Using in userland became frustrating to me," because ""architectural decisions"" limited its functionality. In other terms: Instead of my configured zf2 cache storage", I would sometimes resort to non-portable because it had TTL right there in a single function call.Simply because TTL is **natively** supported by most backends, so there\\\'s no point in imitating it with plugins, listeners or some userland magic. it-just-works so should expose this parameter.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can\\\'t compare it to APC project which has been dedicated to optimizing and caching stuff in php for 10 years now.That\\\'s what I mean:APC is a free, open, and robust framework for caching and optimizing PHP intermediate code.Windows Cache Extension for PHP is a PHP accelerator [...] User Cache  variables can be stored in the user cache and then re-used memcached is a high-performance, distributed memory object caching system [...] intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.The Zend Cache Extension is a collection of APIs for realizing advanced partial caching capabilitiesXCache is a open-source opcode cacher Document storage, key-value storage, sql rdbmses **can** be used as caches, however they\\\'re not meant to be and often have high overhead when trying to emulate silly things like ttl.Yes. And there are better and worse tools for that.Cleaning strategy to me is a strategy on when and what to clean. There can be different strategies implemented in userland or in the caching library. If was using SQL server I could use stored routines and schedules or some other facilities. You admit that the cleaning strategy should be up to the user. I agree.

Performance of filesystem aside for a moment...", you\\\'re trying to argue the semantics of caching functions that exist for years in php world. Look up each individual caching extension listed above.... **each and every one** allows you to set TTL on per-item basis.  Whatever you\\\'ll say you can\\\'t change that. _If it ain\\\'t broke, don\\\'t fix it_.

The first topic was to have per-item TTL. Right now you\\\'re mentioning that some adapters don\\\'t support TTL at all. This is because you\\\'re referring to adapters that do not use real caching libraries / servers / solutions. MongoDB was not envisioned nor designed as a dedicated cache server. It is a document storage server.CVS is not a caching adapter nor format. It is a file format.DBA is not a caching server nor format. It is a database format.MySQL is not a caching server. It is a RDBMS. **Note:** You CAN use each of the above technologies as cache storage. There\\\'s question of if you should or shouldn\\\'t, but you could use them as long as you emulate features that other technologies (read: real caching servers and libs) support. TTL is one of them. by a long shot. Simply put, if you have an adapter that doesn\\\'t support TTL," then it is not a cache adapter but a database. btw: ""There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things"". If there\\\'s not TTL support", then you can\\\'t precisely control time-based invalidation, unless you manually clear items (ugh!) or clear the whole storage (even worse). Additionally," what I call ""broken TTL support"" of adapter would clear items that were not supposed to be cleared", just because after changing TTL on the adapter it will swipe all items that were set before TTL was changed. I\\\'ve been working with Zend_Cache since the beginning. I\\\'ve even written my own Apc-with-tags adapter. The thing that it did right was implement the basic set of features across adapters, even those that were not real caching adapters (like sqlite, which is sql database). Missing features were emulated. That is what I was expecting the component to do and it did it quite well. I love what you\\\'ve done with @marc-mabe, but current TTL implementation is inconsistent across adapters, which makes it useless to me, there\\\'s no per-item TTL setting which is a huge omission, and this PR attempt to solve it an elegant manner. It doesn\\\'t change anything for you, there\\\'s no BC break, you can keep on using it the way you like it.

I recognise that ... it was a mess. The problem we have right now, is that became simplistic, spartan and dysfunctional.

If by default users would use a tentative GC," and assuming the ""default TTL"" set on adapter doesn\\\'t change", then I could manufacture an (delta of default ttl and desired ttl vs time) on the newly created file so it matches the desired per-item TTL. That would deprecate the need for header and still support the use case.

It doesn\'t say anything about the cache itself. (Our filesystem adapter simply writes to the local filesystem we don\'t have a real filesystem implemented in PHP \\\\* g *) But yes", a TTL is not required by storage usable for caching (like dba). @Thinkscape Sure the filesystem **do** check the TTL (mtime of item + configured TTL = expire time).

I don\\\'t think should be a parameter of or  . The TTL is just one of the MANY possible options when saving or retrieving data for a key. As an example, some cache storage layers may require you to specify how many nodes the data should be written in before returning a or a  . Other storage systems simply don\\\'t have a TTL," and different ones may be ""fire-and-forget"" depending on passed in options. That calls for a more complex object", which honestly is an overkill, and which is what is being attempted by PHP-FIG in a useless battle for bloat (that\\\'s my opinion at least). While the is the solution for the 0.01% that need it, a simple interface that allows to and is more than enough. Here\\\'s a list of reasons that are on top of my head right now:1. the TTL, as well as other caching options, are usually depending on configuration2. the consumer of a cache usually has no understanding of the options to be passed when  an item3. putting those  in the consumer of a cache adapter is a violation of the SRP4. putting  in the consumer is a violation of the DIP (now your component depends on those options and not just on a simple cache adapter interface)5. you don\\\'t change those options at runtime, since your service should likely be 6. It rarely happens that a stored item has a different TTL based on its data, and if that\\\'s the case (for example when caching HTTP responses, where you may use the headers), then you can implement a specific storage adapter that extracts that information and wraps around a generic storage adapter and does the trick  \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Per-item TTL is well known, and the parameter is supported by set\\\\* functions on all caching pecl extensions and most php cache libraries.2. Taking APC for example, you have because Zend\\\\Cache gets in the way there is no easy way to pass the third argument. All proposed solutions (plugins, listeners, constantly changing options) add a lot of overhead to something," that is just a simple function call decrease performance.3. TTL is not ""just another option""", it is not the same as i.e. tags (which are very rare in this world). Per-item TTL is a commonly known pattern, as you can easily observe by looking at projects like the server and API supported this and has been architected with this in mind since ver 0.0.1.4. DIP and SRP and other SOLID stuff does not really have much value when talking about cache. Cache must be fast first," then it can be ""proper"" and OOP. Zend_Cache had too much going on", but Zend\\\\Cache now adds a brick wall of principles that obscure basic functionality," in this example TTL. 5. TTL is optional ( ) in all caching extensions and so it is in this PR.6. ""you don\\\'t change those options at runtime"" of course you don\\\'t.

The overhead of method calls is negligible compared to I/OThat\'s because of the specific use case of that specific storage layer. Some storage layers have more complex params than that, some don\'t even come with TTL (it\'s emulated on the client side). A cache implementation doesn\'t dictate over other cache implementations imo. It\'s an implementation vs interface thing IMO. memcache is just one of many out there.Cache is I/O. I/O is slow. Logic upfront that I/O is generally negligible overhead.Then why not allowing generic instead of locking into a more limiting  ?What if my objects have all the same TTL? That\'s the 99% use case. You have the same TTL for a same family of stored items in almost every case, so why setting the TTL at every usage of the storage adapter? The is just an edge case that you may abstract away into a different interface instead of enforcing passing in a TTL at every call and then checking for a default value if none is provided. Additionally, this doesn\'t work when the storage layer doesn\'t support a per-item TTL (which happens depending, again," on implementations).

zendframework,5535,closed,body,2013-11-24 13:15:36,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" The point of **AbstractFactories** is to delegate creation of plethora of different services to a single factory. They receive the following arguments (per interface): Those arguments are used to determine what to create and return from the factory. For example", [DoctrineModule]url  uses an [abstract factory to construct all doctrine namepaced components]url  by regex-parsing the name of the service.  The problem surfaces when trying to use **Aliases on services created by abstract factory**. ### Example We have 3 service classes associated with service names: | Service Name | Real class name  service-foo | Application\\\\Class\\\\Foo  service-bar | Application\\\\Class\\\\Bar  service-baz | Application\\\\Class\\\\Baz | .. and the following abstract factory Now when we try to retrieve a service with we will receive the following arguments: | Service Name | $name | $requestedName  service-foo | servicefoo | service-foo  service-bar | servicebar | service-bar  service-baz | servicebaz | service-baz |### What happens when we use aliases Now let\'s add some aliases this will result in the following parameter values: | Service Name | $name | $requestedName  Alias\\\\Foo | servicefoo | Alias\\\\Foo  Alias\\\\Bar | servicebar | Alias\\\\Bar  Alias\\\\Baz | servicebaz | Alias\\\\Baz | The now contains the name of the requested alias. This is not a bug per se, because we could use it to create branching factories on alias names, however our abstract factory will stop working.### Solution I\'ve modified ServiceManager to pass to the abstract factory methods, so that we know the name of the original class before aliasing and canonization.  This is one of the ways we could use this in our factory: And parameter values will become: | Service Name | $name | $requestedName | $originalName  Alias\\\\Foo | servicefoo | Alias\\\\Foo | service-foo  Alias\\\\Bar | servicebar | Alias\\\\Bar | service-bar  Alias\\\\Baz | servicebaz | Alias\\\\Baz | service-baz |### What\'s changed The PR is fully backward compatible. I have not modified and the extra parameter is considered as optional for all internal SM methods. Existing factories work the same and require no changes. We will probably deprecate name canonization in ZF3 so this will no longer be needed," however for 2.\\\\* there is full BC and allow for smarter abstract factories while remaining fully compatible with aliasing.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its a \'hack\' to make the collection class look like it is working, while it isnt. If you take a look in the ProductFieldset test  be necessary in this test method, if it wasnt necessary in that test asset? Only because that is the first level and this is the second level? Only because in that case you didnt have nested collections? That was added, because the recursion in the Collection class isnt working like it should, and when you have nested collections, there is a bug that the collection tries to set an array to a fieldset(which expects an object). You can remove that line and run the test, you\'ll se what i\'m talking about.  With that, the test is passing, but that doesnt solve the problem, if you had a 3rd level, you would need to have a hydrator for that too. What if you have 10 nested collections (i know it seems impossible, but who ever know...)? Also, that\'s very non-intuitive, i would never guess i had to set a hydrator for a collection if i didnt read this test. And even reading this, it didnt work in my project, because in my project that arrays are doctrine ArrayCollections, so that hydrator didnt work, and i dont know why, the doctrine hydrator didnt work too. Collections are arrays of form elements. In most of cases, they\'re arrays of fieldsets. If you have an array of a Product Entity, and you set it to a collection, the collection should get each element(object) of that array and set it to the fieldset of that collection. All collections work the same way, so why would it need a hydrator? As @danizord told me and i agree with him, the collection class shouldnt even allow us to set a hydrator. You already can set the hydrator in the Fieldsets, you dont need it in the Collections. I know i\'m not providing the solution to this problem, i would if i knew how to, but nobody will also do that if the error is hidden in the tests. I\'m aiming to get more people involved in this issue, since we cant wait to zf3 with something that isnt working.

zendframework,5746,closed,10,2014-01-24 18:39:59,1245.0,,,1,b'b\' @radnan and @Maks3w, that test seems fine. However, I dont agree with that merge, because you\\\'re calling setObject(). That method is bind() extract() responsability. Once you bind your model object to the form, it already calls setObject() and extract(), that extract() call will handle all the nested setObject calls. It is only a matter of having the right hydrator in each fieldset. I\\\'ll agree with the second part,target element needs to have an object and the right hydrator in order to be able to extract the values, but not with the first, since collections are always arrays and since they always receive the same type of data, they don\\\'t need a hydrator.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is especially true for nested fieldsets", where you\'re not binding to anything explicitly and the nested calls have to handle that case. Let\'s take an example. Say we have a entity which has a **product** property. This **product** property is supposed to contain a entity. But when we first create a shop, we haven\'t set a entity yet. So, when we bind this entity to the  ," the inside doesn\'t have anything to bind to. But we need an object to hydrate and return where is it going to get this object? In comes  .
