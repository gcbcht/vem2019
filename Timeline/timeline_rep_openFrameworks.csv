This happens because ""modifier-up"" messages are not sent in the same way as normal and special keys. To test", watch the size of the pressedKeys: Press a modifier key and a normal key -say ctrl-a.  If the \\\'a\\\' is lifted first, then the modified-a key int is removed from the pressedKeys set.  If CTRL is released before the \\\'a\\\', then the non-modified-a key-up int is sent, and it is not erased from the pressedKeys set.  If this is repeated with different modifier+key downs / ups the accumulation occurs. Ultimately, there needs to be better handling of modifier keys.  Perhaps there is a way to use the modifier masks keep track of modifier keys with a call to glutGetModifiers() in the keyboard_cb and keyboard_up_cb static methods? It looks like progress has been made toward this in ofConstants.h But it seems to have stopped there. I\\\'m happy to work on this -any suggestions on a strategy?

It will dump lots of warnings that look something like:  gameoverhack\\\'s 807 pull request would be a very useful set of methods," but instead of calling the calling glutGetModifiers() it should probably work by checking ""pressedKeys"" set with a call that looks like: etc. Thus", for this to really work, there needs to be better modifier bookkeeping at the core site of the original glut callback. As I said, I\\\'m quite interested in getting this working and am happy to tackle it.

openFrameworks,652,open,5,2011-07-15 18:49:46,556.65,,1,,"b'b"" I spent quite a while on this one and am beginning to wonder if it is possible to accurately keep track of keys via the pressedKeys set strategy.  Ultimately the problem lies in the fact that GLUT is only delivering ascii coded values via it\'s keyboard callbacks.  For any given physical key", these singular ascii values can be changed by modifier keys (like ctrl), meaning that in some situations (as described above ctrl+a, then release ctrl, then release a), keeping a simple list of ascii coded values will lead to unpredictable results -basically all keyDowns are not guaranteed to have a matching keyUp.  The ideal ways to keep track of pressedKeys is to have a keyEvent system that records keyboard activity based on physical keyCodes -or at least some sense of VirtualKeys (i.e. VK_LEFT, etc).  Examples include Java\'s [KeyEvent]url  system or a Javascript strategy like [this]url If we had input events at this level, it would also easily take care of issue here #807.  In the mean-time," you can check out my proposed solution to keymodifier issue over at issue #807.  At least it is possible to have a robust solution to that problem.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lots of custom code handling -retina situations, adapting to what  reports, handling @2x res images.... Having something to handle this elegantly would be great.  I totally vote for @ofTheo\\\'s: and making pixelDensity affect all the units across OF: ofFBOs, ofTTF, ofTouchEvents, ofDrawBitmapString, etc...  I would also be inclined on setting those automatically on each platform; Say, on a retina iPhone, there are 960 x 640 pixels on screen, but those pixels are so small that it almost makes no sense to treat them as such (for example, using ofDrawBitmapString draws such small type that is almost unreadable). I think OF should automatically set the pixelDensity given the device capabilities, but  should report always 480 x 320. OF would handle internally what happens at draw time, so ofRect(0,0,10,10) would draw a 20 x 20 pixel rect in reality, but the user wouldn\\\'t need to handle that... Got some doubts though, it might be  how to proceed for a few elements ( videoGrabbers come to mind; let\\\'s say we are on PixelDensity == 2, does requesting a 640 x 480 connect to the device @ 1280 x 960? ) Maybe a solution would be two keep two different nomenclatures in all methods that accept width & height," something in the lines of ""ScreenUnits"" for anything related to screen (and subject to pixelDensity)"," and ""pixels"" to anything related to external devices like grabbers", etc... otherwise it might be hard to guess which units to use in every situation\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems to mix both raw and (via  ).  It seems that all of them could be replaced with  .  The only hangup I found is when the window itself calls the window manager to activate the current window using the argument.  That could be fixed via a friend class setup.  Another option would be to get rid of the default constructor on and use something like to keep it all raw-pointer free.  Maybe it\'s not a big deal, but it seems that we need to do one or the other and not mix.  Then in the destructor for we just need to make sure that the window manager and glfw both are notified and everything is destroyed in the correct order ... (perhaps not trivial :)).I\'m wondering if our ofEvents need to have a base field with a window id (ideally just an unsigned int)?  I\'m imagining that you could add (referring to the main class as a listener to the main window, if the main window class implemented / extended the listener).  In such a case, it would be important to know where various events were coming from.With GLFW, we can get rid of the bug-prone #652 , although with GLFW it might stay updated a little better ... or maybe not.  Is there an easy way that we could bypass that functionality when using the glfw window?  It seems like you might just look at the current window and see if it is glfw.Fullscreen it looks like this is still not implemented on os x and will need to be custom platform-specific code, unless we destroy and create the new windows each time the is changed?  Any idea why glfw doesn\'t implement this internally?  It seems like a pretty basic thing ... ? More thoughts over the next few days. Overall, this is a very exciting (and much needed) departure from GLUT.  Even if it didn\'t offer multiple windows it would be an upgrade!""'

I\'ll just post my initial thoughts right now:Sure we could use an ofWindowPtr somehow. (I\'m not going into all the technical problems now.) What is your main reason for this? Cosmetics or functionality? I\'m asking because if I as a user request a window pointer, I\'ll assume that all destruction etc will be handled internally. Or are you rather concerned that a user might accidentally keep an ofWindow\\\\* that actually points to a destroyed window?I have created a base class ofWindowEvent for that purpose that has a pointer to the ofWindow that is sending the event. This touches the ofWindowPtr thing but I think it might be more convenient than just an id? url  AFAIK glfw also does not have this handled right. But I think with custom window code and glfwGetKey() to check whether a modifier key is pressed, we might be able to get somewhere? (Have you ever tried this. It\'s also not flawless but is the right direction url  )I have no idea why this isn\'t implemented. It also wasn\'t in the older version. I think the idea is to either use game mode or windowed mode... (?) But it is fairly easy to build in, so I\'m  not that concerned about it. I\'ll try the mac version when I get to a mac again.

openFrameworks	1470	closed	30	bakercp	2012-08-08 11:41:24	529.47		+1		b'b\' I\\\'ve continued to spend more time on this today and have a few discussion questions / propositions, particularly related to input events.1. the event has traditionally reported both the drag position AND the (supposed) button that is being pressed to cause the ""move"" to become a ""drag"".  But, in the current paradigm, that single number does not completely describe the situation of multiple buttons being pressed, or pressed and released in succession.  Instead, if you really want to know which buttons are being pressed, you must call with an optional argument to query a specific button.  GLFW (like many windowing systems) does not report ""drag"" events, but rather reports mouse movement and lets the user check to see if any mouse button is pressed.  Thus, instead of making documentation caveats about what the ""button"" in the drag function actually means, I\\\'d propose removing the ""button"" argument from the drag function and encouraging the use of to discover the true nature of the buttons being pressed.2. Unified touch / mouse and ""pointer"" events.  This one may be more controversial, but I would propose that we take the opportunity to unite touch and mouse events into a single event.  Pointer is the term used by Microsoft and others to describe ""pointing"" input devices like touches, mice, trackballs, pens, etc.  While many of the parameters like ""touch size"" and ""pressure"" would simply be set to default static values for a mouse event (for instance), it would offer more flexibility for guis, etc.  Within the there would be an enum that described the device ""type"" (mouse, touch, pen, etc).  GLFW has plans to incorporate touch events in the 3.0 roadmap, and most modern operating systems now support touch events to varying degrees.  This would also help us move toward making ios apps look a little more like desktop apps, and would also allow easy integration with addons like  , TUIO, and addons that attempt to leverage the OSX multitouch private framework.3. I\\\'d propose starting an official openFrameworks branch for this so that it is easy for people to start testing this very thoroughly.  I\\\'d also propose going GLUT free on that test branch rather than having both windowing systems living side by side (which I know was @underdoeg original intent). I\\\'m pushing a bunch of updates, additions and proposals over to @underdoeg tomorrow for discussion.  @kylemcdonald perhaps we can talk about some of this in the IRC meetup tomorrow?\''
openFrameworks	1470	closed	31	ofZach	2012-08-08 11:41:24	488.48	+1			b'b"" quickly, I\'m not a huge fan of (1) since it seems sort of counter intuitive to me.  It probably makes sense to look at a majority of cross platform window systems (ie, url  and see what they do.  To be honest, I haven\'t seen that many mouseMoved only window systems, but maybe I haven\'t seen that many window systems :)  curious what other people think ? but 2 would make a lot of sense and it\'s something that\'s been discussed before .  I would support very much.  ofPointer is kind of an easily misleading name however, since pointer / ptr has so much c++ connotation.  Also, we sort of already have this with the touch event in ofEvents:  so it might just be a matter of finding a way to make the mouse events mesh better with the touch events.  a branch for this kind of development sounds good to me....""'

But it sure makes sense and that is why all window managers implement it in that way. But on the other hand with OF we\\\'re trying to simplify stuff (otherwise you could just use glfw directly...) I feel like it is always some sort of balancing act between simplicity and the ""correct"" way to do things. I like the approach to have the most common usage wrapped up as easily as possible and if you need special functionality you can get it by a little digging into the more hidden functions. But about the dragging and mouse pressed argument in general. What if mouse pressed was some sort of specialized vector? so you\\\'d have a syntax like  (0) //button  0 is pressed or that could also be (OF_MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT)  2 absolutely needs to be done in the near future IMO 3 With this multiwindow branch we could go two ways. a) to simply remove GLUT and replace with GLFW without touching the general syntax as much as possible. That\\\'s what I tried to do so far and in this case I don\\\'t mind having GLUT still in there as an option. or b) to rethink how input events, and other window events are handled and do it in a smarter way. But that probably leads to signficant API changes and may even result in compatibility issues with older apps. When I started the branch, I would have loved to do b) straight away but I thought the proper way would probably be to do a) first and when glfw if properly within OF and everything works as before, we can move to b).  But I also think we should have a branch on the official OF repo.\''

My tests project / files and output is here: url  Basically, the mis-colored anti-aliasing you are getting is due to an issue with blending on FBOs where it takes the cast of the ofClear color (i.e. black in your examples) EVEN if the opacity was 0. You can test this by changing your clear color to say - .  This will result in a green cast. This issue also affects anti-aliased lines on an FBO," etc. I am not sure how to ""fix"" (or even if it should be considered a bug or just normal opengl behavior). To prevent it from happening", just make sure your clear color is white with 0 opacity, i.e.  . @bogru -you do this initially when you clear your FBO on creation, but then you clear with non-white colors elsewhere. Perhaps an opengl / fbo expert could weigh in on this blending behavior?  There are lots of images in my linked project above. Regarding the lack of changes associated with calling alphablend, etc with fonts, I believe alpha blending is forced on during rendering for fonts because without it, all anti aliasing / hinting disappears resulting in blocky fonts.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
openFrameworks,1623,open,12,2012-09-28 17:07:43,857.58,,1,,b'b\' I think it is normal to have a color cast, (even is opacity is 0 inbackground image, as alpha from drawn  will be used forblending), if we have alpha blending. But if there is no alpha blending,"the values from the drawn element should not be altered by values inbackground. ""Regarding the lack of changes associated with calling alphablend", etc withfonts, I believe alpha blending is forced on during rendering for fontsbecause without it," all anti aliasing / hinting disappears resulting inblocky fonts.""It is not necessary to disappear. At the border it is enough to havedecreased alpha (as it is now with AA)", and it will blend nicely withwhatever background will be further used. Moreover, it is not correct, ifalpha blending is disabled," to have alpha blending. (ie alter the rgbvalues depending on background and alpha) The ""solution"" with white background is not acceptable", as the white willstill be blended into font color at the borders of the font.

So currently in the CPP if ofSetOrientation(fooBar)  isn\'t called it defaults to OF_ORIENTATION_DEFAULT and that gets set at Java_cc_openframeworks_OFAndroid_onSurfaceCreated() in .  In the JAVA we never actually make the call to CPP to change the oF orientation we just setup the Activity in  using the setScreenOrientation(int orientation) method.  So I guess the problem is that when we change the Orientation of the Activity in the JAVA layer it is never getting communicated to the CPP layer.

As long as any programmer working on the class knows that this is safe because the call to ofImage::update() is forced to happen in the main thread because it waits for the event, and as long as ofImage isn\'t restructured in a way that makes a call to loadImage() no longer intrinsically thread-safe wrt the values of isAllocated, width and height, then this will continue to be bad design.  Understanding why and how not break this requires a pretty thorough knowledge of the ofImage internals and multithreaded programming, as well as recognizing the subtletly of the update call only happening in the main thread. But there\'s no comments in the class that properly explain this for future developers, and there\'s no guarantee that something in ofImage might change behind your back in the meantime which makes this system no longer safe.

The issue is that opening via the ID is not opening with the now sorted index but the original bus id ( which is basically the order you plug the kinects in ). So the sorting is actually having no effect.  Here are two cases where I plug in the same two kinects but in a different order.  Notice in the second list device B shows up with id 0 and device A has id 1. The devices are sorted correctly in the device list but calling will produce two different results as it matches against the id and not the index.  So in the second scenario will actually open the second device in the device list and not the first.

Did you try to move your  block to the draw() method to see what happens? My bet would be that all is good there. I see this as a feature rather than a bug", since it encourages people to keep OpenGL operations within draw() rather than using update(). Although drawing within update() is perfectly ok normally, this has the implication that there are no default shaders bound. When the draw() method starts, the programmable GL renderer will bind the default shaders. It will then make sure _always_ to have a shader bound during draw(). It doesn\'t do so for performance reasons in update(). Personally, I try to keep all openGL related methods & calls within draw() all these methods have to execute on the main thread, after all and i put all non-openGL methods & calls into update(). By sticking to this principle, i can do multi-threaded work on update()," whilst keeping draw() single-threaded and (OpenGL) thread-safe.

openFrameworks,2593,closed,7,2013-09-30 23:24:36,47.67,,,1,"b'b"" @bilderbuchi good point! Turns out", as soon as you issue a draw command within update() on any non-RPi platforms, the default shaders get bound.  This doesn\'t happen on RPi, since it uses a special one-fits-all default shader for perfomance reasons (shader swaps are costly on RPi), and any requests to swap the default shaders get rejected on RPi because there, uniqueshader is set to true. The problem is, when you call any draw operations before the draw loop binds a default shader explicitly, no shader will be bound. One remedy for this would be to call beginDefaultShaders earlier, and explicitly on RPi. Like, when the renderer is set up: @jvcleave," could you insert  into ofGLProgrammableRenderer#L1684 and let me know if that solves the issue?""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

openFrameworks,2696,open,body,2013-11-27 14:45:22,00:00,,1,,b'b\' One thing that is sometimes limiting about the classes (when trying to implement an OSC  model), is that each side involved in a networking exchange needs to know the other side\\\'s  beforehand. It would be convenient to be able to open an  , serving a specific port, and have it reply to whatever clients make requests. At the same time, it\\\'d be nice to be able to write a client such that it only needs to know the server\\\'s ," but the server doesn\\\'t need to know anything about the client (e.g. doesn\\\'t need to know beforehand what port to reply to). The client simply makes a request (says ""hello"") to the server", and the server gets the reply port from the endpoint of the incoming message. But when the client has separate and (as must be the case now), then each of these will have a different port -client messages received by the server show the port of the client\\\'s sender, and replies back to that same port wouldn\\\'t be seen by its receiver. The server needs to know the client\\\'s receiver port -so why not make it the _same_ as the sender port (in cases when this is desired?). I made a fix (for my own use) for this problem. If you\\\'re interested, you can see it here: url  In summary: I added a method on  . This means a receiver listens for incoming messages (as usual), but also send messages from the same socket (which means they will show up on the receiving end with the same port number). The is also not tied to send to a single ; it can send to different endpoints on the fly. This functionality is supported by the underlying oscpack library (well, by sockets themselves), but it\\\'s not exposed in oF. With my change, you can do (in  ): and receive messages as usual, in your method (using  ). But then, you can also do: I can submit a pull request with this basic functionality, but isn\\\'t a full solution. I thought I\\\'d submit an issue here because it\\\'s still useful," to get some feedback on whether this is of general interest. A ""proper"" fix might move to a helper file", so it could be shared by both and  . And, probably we\\\'d want to implement  , and maybe a method (I don\\\'t know about this new parameter-syncing stuff).  If we\\\'re doing all that, perhaps it would make more sense to create a totally new class, or else a base class from which both sender and receiver could inherit, to avoid code duplication. Unfortunately, I don\\\'t have time to do those at the moment.

openFrameworks,2696,open,7,2013-11-27 14:45:22,588.22,,1,,b'b\' I took a look at oscpack, but I don\\\'t see how you can, because it seems the socket has to be bound, in order to get its local endpoint (there is an at the start of  ).  However, of course you can\\\'t bind an ofxOscSender (unless you make a sort of combined , which is essentially what I was suggesting above). Really, I think the easiest thing would be to add and methods to the ofxOscReceiver, that would allow you to send messages without being connected to remote points (a connect could also be added," for convenience when talking to a single point).  If you don\\\'t like the conceptual ""contamination""", then add a new class that can both receive and send.  Alternatively, yes, _if_ there was a way to get the local port number that is being used by a connected ofxOscSender and _if_ indeed it works to create an ofxOscReceiver bound to that (shared) port number, then that would be a solution," and would not break the  paradigm by putting ""send"" methods in a receiver...  It seems to me that if UdpSocket (or OfxOscSender) had a method that called on the underlying socket", I think that would give us the port number.  I don\\\'t know whether binding a Receiver to that port would actually work, although from what you say above, it seems like it should (since ports are now set up to be shared).  I don\\\'t have a  lot of time to look at this right now, but maybe I could quickly try it. By the way, this usage (sending from and receiving on the same socket) is very typical in applications.  (Personally, I like the idea of a single  that can do this.)  If you look at languages like SuperCollider or , they tend to send and receive on the same local port number.  If I send to an ofxOscReceiver from the SuperCollider language, for example, the messages\\\' remote endpoint is port 57120.  If I send OSC messages back from oF to port 57120, the SuperCollider language receives them.  Nice and simple.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
openFrameworks,2696,open,8,2013-11-27 14:45:22,634.77,,1,,b'b\' Okay, I tested this out.  I added a new member on ofxOscSender, and it calls  ," passing the (stored) address we connected to in  .  And it seems to work.  I created oF ""client"" and ""server"" apps", which talk to each other, using these shared port. The only thing is I need to get rid of that assert at the start of  , about requiring to be bound.  The socket is already connected, and so we can request the local endpoint.  A nicer (but more messy, because it involves considerably more changes in oscpack, adding things to the implementing class, etc) would be to add a method that just returns the local endpoint of a connected socket, without requiring you to pass a target address.

It\\\'s much more specific than I originally thought, but needs a fix anyway.  Basically, the way the makefiles work is that they gather up all of the possible source directories in a project and then apply a set of exclusion filters that include: The problem is that make does not deal well with spaces in paths," so when any subfolder in a project has a space in the folder name any folder name token after a space gets treated as a new folder and is not excluding.  This causes to fail when looking for source files in that folder because the ""folder"" doesn\\\'t actually exist. So", basically we need to figure out a better way of dealing with the spaces. Anyway, the reason I discovered this was because we include an of distribution (which includes the ofxKinect addon) in the  folder of ofSketch ... but the problem turns out to be slightly more general than that.

For any OpenGL card, be it nvidia or amd or intel, drivers of some sort need to be installed. CUDA drivers are neither needed for OpenGL nor openFrameworks, CUDA is an Nvidia specific GPGPU api. The trouble with OpenGL 1.1 is that oF never truly supported it. Things like frame buffers, which are not part of OpenGL 1.1, have been part of openFrameworks in the fixed function pipeline for ages, and it wouldn\'t make sense to make it more complex to maintain and extend our renderers just to support a legacy api.

In ofBoxExample", the logo appears flipped  3. ofBoxExample is drawn through a camera and does not call setupPerspective, the camera will therefore not flip the viewport (as ofCamera is constructed with by default) 4. when drawing ofPlane and ofBox without a camera the logo appears correct (axis show: Y-down, X-right)  From this i would conclude: 1. adding to in ofBoxExample will fix the flipped apparance of the logo, as this sets for camera.  Note that ofCamera has no member initialisers and the ofCamera constructor sets to by default. On the other hand, has as default argument.  Perhaps we should move  \'s initialisers to member initializers," so that initial values for these fields are visible from the header file already?

openFrameworks,3158,closed,body,2014-08-20 20:18:39,00:00,1,,,"b'b"" I haven\'t fully investigated the root cause", but the problem is related to iOS 8 changes to how it controls view bounding boxes. It seems that they do not change after rotation. I\'m cross-referencing issues #931, #1477, and #1976, though I\'m making a new issue because my understanding that this is a iOS 8 specific issue, though related. Edit: Also cross-referencing PR #2290. Also linking related forum [thread]url  Observed behavior: using current versions if iOS + OF, the app will appear to always start in Portrait, despite setting the project to start in Landscape and disabling all Portrait orientations. You\'ll typically see a blank region on the right-hand side of your screen. It seems that your app is drawing Landscape while the device is oriented Portrait. ~~Disabling hardware orientation will allow you to draw the app correctly, but the device will always orient as Portrait. Additionally, activating the Notification or Control Center can cause the app to suddenly change orientation.~~  Update (10/13):I\'m currently using Xcode 6OS X 10.10 Beta 5Latest OF Master as of 10/13iPhone 6 w/ iOS 8.0.2 ~~Project details:Xcode 6 beta 6OS X 10.10 (14A299l)OF 0.8.3 (I\'ve looked through the current master and nothing looks like it applies)Tested on: iPhone 5s (7.1.2), iPad Air (7.1.2), iPad 2 (8.0 (12A4345d))~~ Potential Fix:the ofxiOSViewController is switching the width and height values based on orientation to get the correct center and bounding box.

Basically if I rotate a device in general, that\\\'s all that\\\'s happening. The fact that there\\\'s an animated transform rotation is kind of beside the point. And most of the time your application really doesn\\\'t need to do anything. It\\\'s going to gracefully stretch and do whatever it needs to do as the bounds change. Okay, so what does that mean? Well, you will recall that we have these APIs that have been around for a long time. Well, we\\\'re getting rid of them. And [Applause]-ah, I thought you guys all loved these. So one of the things about these APIs, and I think I\\\'ve been on this stage before saying,"You shouldn\\\'t do layout based on interface orientation. You shouldn\\\'t use these methods to drive your layout."" They\\\'re really kind of focused methods. You wanted to use them because you wanted to participate in this rotation event. So now we\\\'ve generalized it. We have this other method called viewWillTransitionToSize:w ithTransitionCoordinator that takes over. So, first of all, all those rotation callbacks can be replaced with this more general notion of viewWillTransitionToSize: withTransitionCoordinator. Where I found the transcript: url \''

The animation is also incorrect when rotating ""twice""", as in from a Landscape to Landscape, or Portrait to Portrait. Something related to the screen center not setting properly, maybe. Replacing the same code that I changed previously in ofxiOSViewController::rotateToInterfaceOrientation() this keeps ofGetWidth() & ofGetHeight() working properly, which is what I assume the majority of users are implementing (I had switched to using screenSize while fixing this, so I didn\\\'t notice that I forgot to update the bounds).

It also adds a function which lets you find a device by partial name, and optionally with an i/o channel count. You can also set an ofSoundStream\\\'s device with an ofSoundDevice directly (instead of just via ID). Does this fit your use-case @kylemcdonald ? **EDIT**: As merged, there isn\\\'t a new global function," and works the same as before (but returns a  ).

openFrameworks,3384,closed,body,2014-11-01 16:27:32,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" This removes almost all statics", singletons and global calls (like ofPushMatrix, ofGetWidth...) from the core, at least form the graphics and core events pipeline. To do that, the following function based apis have been transformed into classes:ofGraphics3dofBitmapFontofEvents -while keeping the api totally backwards compatible. Windows now contain their own renderer and core events instance and notify that instead of the global one. Each renderer contains it\'s own ofGraphics3d and ofBitmapFont, which avoids singletons allowing multiwindow or multicontext even on different threads if everything is done through a explicit renderer. There\'s a new class ofMainLoop which is the only singleton in the rendering pipeline and is responsible of creating new windows and calling them in a loop if the window doesn\'t provide it\'s own loop as is the case of glut, android and iphone. the old syntax to create windows is still working but there\'s a new way which is the preferred one: where one can pass width, height and window mode (windowed, fullscreen...) to the settings like: or: there\'s also specializations of the window settings like: or  egl," iOS and android should have their own window settings class although that\'s not implemented yet. the EGL and iOS windows indeed still need to be refactored to use the new api. To use multiwindow the syntax is: and simpler using c++11: There\'s also a way of creating a window without associated app and just bind some of it\'s events to an existing app. There\'s a couple of examples showing both cases in the events folder. Also every class that can be drawn or binded can be called the traditional way like: or through a renderer like: which allows to use different gl contexts or even windows from different threads for example. this api is still experimental but there\'s an example on how to use it in ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This error does not appear if don\'t set the pixels to the default format and everything renders fine. It also does not appear for the  for example, even if I set the default format. In addition it seems to me that this error is actually misleading, since if I force the player to render on the default format I will get a result that seems to me correct i.e the movie seems to render properly on the default colorspace . EDIT: Not sure about the above comment anymore since I just tried the programmable renderer to see if the colorspace conversion would work properly but it doesn\'t..

There is a mistake in my first post", that I talk about at the end here, but I was right about and returning the same value regardless of the pixel type, which you can get from the following snippet: The output I get from this is that size() and getTotalBytes() return the same values in all 4 cases. Looking at the source, is defined as and is trivial, just returning  , where is set to a nonzero value twice, once in   and again in allocate In all three cases, is used with the same arguments. It doesn\'t seem like is defined incorrectly. For example, for above, I get 600. That is 10 \\\\* 10 \\\\* 2 \\\\* 3, 2 being the size of unsigned short and 3 being the number of channels. If found another example where is used incorrectly for its current value: If already returns the number of bytes, then multiplying it by sizeof(PixelType) means that memcpy is going to copy too many bytes. Here it seems like is supposed to mean  . Maybe this is supposed to divide by  ? Looking at the that I was talking about in my first post, I can now see that I was making a mistake in what I though should be returning to work properly. I was thinking that ofPixels::operator[] returned some version of  , but that was dumb. It returns each component of what might be an  , so should return for both versions of to work correctly. In 0.8.4, is defined as: I\'m not saying that has to change," but it seems like there is disagreement about what it does within the code.

Some thoughts:Our implementation of assumes according to the doxy that both vectors are unit vectors, which is not guaranteed in the above it might need a normalize of the eye vector ? I assume that the implementation of generates a quaternion which would rotate vector to vector using the cross product of the two vectors as the rotation axis. If the vectors represent a full u-turn, this case is caught and dealt with, but in a way which I can\\\'t totally follow without reading up on the maths. I wonder if the camera might start rolling (rotating on its z-axis) under some circumstances (e.g. if higher or lower than the  ), but this might look cool.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

openFrameworks,5008,closed,body,2016-03-21 02:28:15,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" Hi", I\'ve just came across the issue that the c++ STL standard containers require the move  in member objects to be \'noexcept\' to allow move operations. The compiler might be clever in some cases but this is not guaranteed. I checked the oF sources and saw that none of the move constructors and assignements for containers (like ofPixels or ofImage) are noexcept. I made a little test program to show that in a vector of ofPixels, the pixel data is copied for reallocations instead of being moved. What do you think about adding noexcept? Are there any drawbacks? See copy_ for the behaviour of oF containers inside a vector and compare it with move_," where I made a class Foo with a noexcept move constructor. (Try to delete \'noexcept\' and see how vector will do copies instead.) Links: url url  [copy_vs_]url ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

From what I understand the confusion / issue is the lack of data path controls within ofFile and by extension the classes that use it.

Catching the exception around just hides away the issue temporarily, as when the fails," the thread remains ""bugged"" and can\\\'t be deleted (I haven\\\'t found a way to do so without a crash). You can at least detect when this happened by checking the if the thread ID is valid (see [here]url The issue seems partly caused because detach() is called from within the thread itself; if I call detach right away from the main thread after creating it", the problem disappears that\\\'s the main difference in my alternative ofThread implementation [here]url  I\\\'ve been searching for docs on to confirm if its allowed to use it from within the thread, or some advice on where should it be called from," but I found nothing about it \\xe2\\x80\\x93 although all the examples I come across seem to use from the main thread.  It seems everything is easier if you to know what you will do with the thread before you spawn it (and I mean ""what will you do"" in terms of cleanup strategy; will you join it or will you detach it?). We added in the first place (#2506) bc if the user doesn\\\'t explicitly on the ofThread object from the main thread", ofThread ends up leaking resources and those add up leading to an inability to spawn threads. Detaching is currently almost the very last thing the ofThread does. We can not really delay it any further, and if your is very short lived, the issue will to happen from time to time if we blindly as we currently do. My current solution only works for me because I know beforehand that I will not be joining the thread I\\\'m spawning; thus I can afford to detach it safely from the main thread as soon as I spawn it.  As it seems detaching from the main thread rises no issue, I wonder if an ofThread API change enforcing the user to spawn the thread explicitly stating a cleanup strategy would be to ask too much for the user because doing so would solve the problem.  I could see something along the lines of  ; if we know what the user expects to do from the thread (i.e. no plans to join it) then we can detach it right away from the main thread from startThread() (as the user guarantees  will not  join the thread). In the other case, if the user starts a thread telling ofThread that  plans to join the thread, we can issue detect a broken promise and issue warning if the threadedFunction() exits and the method hasn\\\'t been called (i.e. the user forgot to join the thread), reminding the user about the resource leak. Either way I think we should not automatically from the thread itself as it can fail under partly unclear circumstances (how short-lived is too short for a thread to fail  ?).  This may be a lot to ask for the users but I believe this will also make the users more aware about the internals of threads and general app architecture, which I would argue is beneficial. I think adding an example demonstrating the two cases would also make things much more clear.  We should probably leave the current API as it is with unchanged behaviour for backwards compatibility, and add two alternative spawn methods i.e. and for more advanced users who have a clear idea on what their thread will do.  PD: Yes the overhead on this example is ludicrous but I merely built it to be able to reproduce the issue. I have a centralised queue that limits on how many requests (i.e. threads) can happen per frame, but because I also have other threads spawning across other areas of the app (and the modules aren\\\'t really aware of each other)," the issue still arises from time to time when a few spawn too ""close"" to each other.  \''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

openFrameworks,5492,open,body,2017-03-15 02:30:03,00:00,,1,,b'b\' I tried to remove color from ofVboMesh\\\'s color array and it seems to have no effect on drawing whereas if I use ofMesh, it works correctly.  Here\\\'s a test code below.  in ofApp.h  ofVboMesh mesh; //ofMesh works correctly but not ofVboMesh.  in //-void ofApp::setup(){  (ofVec3f(0,0,0)); (ofVec3f(100,0,0)); (ofVec3f(100,100,0)); (ofVec3f(0,100,0));  (0); (1); (3); (1); (2); (3);  (ofFloatColor(1,0,1,1)); (ofFloatColor(1,0,0,1)); (ofFloatColor(0,1,0,1)); (ofFloatColor(0,0,1,1)); }  //-void ofApp::update(){  }  //-void ofApp::draw(){  ofTranslate(50, 50); (); }  //-void ofApp::keyPressed(int key){  if (key == OF_KEY_RETURN) {  if (()) {    size_t lastIndex = ()-1;   (lastIndex, ofFloatColor(0,0,0,"0));   (lastIndex);   }   cout << ""numColors : "" << () << endl; } }  And this is the result you get when you run the code. And when you press the \\\'return\\\' key", last color should be removed from the color vector. For example if you press the key twice, the result should look as below. But if I use ofVboMesh, removing color from vector doesn\\\'t have any effect on the drawing until the vector gets emptied.  it seems the vbo is not being refreshed when ofVboMesh\\\'s color vector is changed through remove.  Also, I think it would make more sense to automatically make the color cleared to ofFloatColor(0,0,0,0) as soon as color gets removed from the vector.  Meaning," the code should still work even without ""(lastIndex", ofFloatColor(0,0,0,"0));"" in ofApp::keyPressed(int key) {}  \''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We should probably think a bit more about this...  There can be many more indices in the indices vector than vertices, because a vertex can be named multiple times when drawing triangles, for example. But each vertex must have the same number of attributes, and this means, the number of colors, texCoords, normals and positions in a vboMesh must always be the same, and in sync with the number of vertices.  @cuinjune If a mesh has colors attributes for vertices, *all* vertices must have a color, but you can still set the color for individual vertices like you did by  ," that\\\'s black and transparent. Transparent will look like ""no color"" but it still is a color", and the GPU is happy, and the eye, too =)\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Something since I last checked means it happens regardless of ofSetOrientation calls. All you need to do now to kill the screen on iOS is create and try and clear an FBO in ofApp::setup Put this in ofApp::setup on iOS   My guess is that because the rendering / render surfaced isn\'t fully setup somehow at the time ofApp::setup is called when Fbo::end is called it doesn\'t correctly restore the matrix / surface etc to the correct setting.

First of all I want to make it clear that **works fine as before** but the compilation of the cameralensOffsetExample gives these errors. It is to be noted that OpenCV 4 does not have any cv.h header file. Moreover the PKG_CONFIG errors from the compilation show that what is being searched is opencv and not opencv4", so the nightly version was not updated for OpenCV 4. So I tried compiling again after renaming the opencv4.pc file in // to  but to avail as cv.h will not be found anyway. Moreover since you said that all worked fine on your latest Arch system," I am intrigued if you were using OpenCV 4 or 3. The Cairo problem still persists.'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
