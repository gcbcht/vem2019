[it]url  says ""List all issues across all the authenticated user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s visible repositories including owned repositories", member repositories," and organization repositories"". So", if the issues are created in the repository you don\\\'t own or you\\\'re not a member of, then you simply cannot list the issues. These issues are not visible in other words. After all, the reason why I closed this issue is because this is not a GitHub Android client\\\'s issue. And I don\\\'t think it\\\'s a bug in the API too. The concern is how we can enhance the API so that we can see all issues that we created ourselves regardless. And for you, I have forwarded this concern. I will get back to you once I received their response. Cheers\'',,,

After referring to the blog url  I changed the version of Android gradle plugin to be 1.1.0 and added junit in the dependencies. I added 18 unit tests for class IconAndViewTextManager.

So the suggestion is to really just remove a bad feature. I guess this is just personal preference but generally when there is an intro screen like that, it gives a quick  of what the app does, not a history of how the app came to be.  Here are a few more thoughts to why the welcome screen should be removed:  The Welcome screen pictures add no substance to the experience as it is fairly unrelated to what the text says. The and are available only in two languages, one of them being English. So though this feature may not have any program bugs but there is still maintenance required on it," which is translating the text into multiple languages. The whole point of the welcome screen is boiled down to one sentence ""So a while ago the GitHub app was discontinued and some of us wanted something new [so] we move[d] the app under a new name and are now PocketHub"". Surely we don\\\'t need to add the many resources and Java classes associated with this feature just to get this one line across. If you still want this text"," we could just move it to the screen that prompts the user to press the ""Login"" button.  I\\\'m interested in having a bit more of a discussion (as stated in []url  Stating that we should keep a part of the app just because it is implemented without any further explanation as to why we should keep it is kind of offhand.\''",,,,

I do see the maintenance work for translations but that\'s not my biggest concern around the project right now.  For the user side I think we did it to push the old users over.

So as is see it for now I\'d rather work on fixing up the thing that actually are broken than things that work and aren\'t hurting the app (which I don\'t think this is).
