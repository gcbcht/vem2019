There\'s no security vulnerability that we know of, we\'re not supporting that feature because of usability issues: we\'ve found out in the past that enabling MD in email is a clusterfuck of failure (we tried it on Tender) because people just expect their emails to be in plaintext (e.g. they just copy and paste code into the email), and the end result is always crazy formatting. If you add to that the fact that you get no Markdown preview once you reply to the email, you end up with a **lot** of broken formatting on the website. That\'s why we just show plaintext from email replies at GitHub -no formatting whatsoever. Email is and should always be plaintext. Lastly, the autoimage feature was already on my TODO list... It\'ll sure come in handy, but with so many corner cases I want to make sure the implementation is solid. Cheers man, hope that was helpful. PS: nice website there, though I\'m more into dubstep than hiphop these days. ;) If you are indeed considering to switch to Redcarpet there," feel free to open as many issues as you require to make the transition as smooth as possible.
