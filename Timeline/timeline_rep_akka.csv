akka,81,closed,body,2011-06-03 14:43:42,00:00,1,,,"b""b' Hello Hakkers", We are contemplating changing our worker infrastructure to akka. For that, we have performed some tests and that required the possibility to check for emptiness of an actor mailbox. Our use case currently requires the processing inside an actor to be performed only when its mailbox is empty. Since checking for the mailbox size is expensive," we thought this would be a nice addition to the use case. I hope this makes sense and the changes are useful for everyone. **EDIT**The ReceiveTimeout feature can also benefit from the changes in this commit as described in the follow up posts below.'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

akka,81,closed,10,2011-06-03 14:43:42,1195.47,1,,,"b'b"" Hi Viktor",so I\'m still making up a case for the isEmpty feature and maybe if you could consider the microbenchmark below:url It tests the ReceiveTimeout feature that makes use of the mailbox size in the message invocation (invoke) in the actor. While profiling, the microbenchmark gets stuck in this method when using the receivetimeout feature: protected[akka] def checkReceiveTimeout() { cancelReceiveTimeout() if ( && **(this) <= 0**) { //Only reschedule if desired and there are currently no more messages to be processed   _futureTimeout = Some((this, ReceiveTimeout, , )) } } By using the isEmpty feature and default configuration the performance increases by a whopping factor of 173 which is the same as when not using the receive timeout feature on the unpatched version (i.e. without this commit). Please, accept this pull request," we _really_ need that extra performance and the flexibility to use any queue. Thank you so much again for taking the time.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This could be a possible security leak when something manages to send a message to the connection actor (of course there are all kinds of security leaks if something manages to send messages around but this seems particularly easy). Before just had a parameter which", of course," isn\'t serializable. The question is if you should be able to use if you aren\'t on the local machine. A problem is that (or linux  ) may block on file IO when the network is faster than the disk. I\'m currently using a single pinned dispatcher to schedule all of the IO operations on. It would probably make sense to have more than one thread executing file IO or in the best case a number IO threads per disk which isn\'t easy to achieve. As an aside: Getting around synchronous disk IO on Linux seems to be quite hard. The support in the kernel for asynchronous disk IO on Linux is still lacking. The biggest problem probably seems to be that aio only works on files opened with O_DIRECT circumventing buffering (e.g. see url ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

akka,1709,closed,4,2013-09-05 14:46:08,1322.07,1,,,b'b\' I see at least three alternatives to this currently proposed solution:1. Don\\\'t change anything  This would require all applications building on top of akka-io to actively manage writes combining memory with disk data (or non-continous disk data," e.g. from several files) themselves. This can be done with explicit ACKs that trigger the sending of the next chunk after having been received by the application. In spray this would require us to write a new pipeline stage that does this. Apart from hurting latency _and_ throughput (not a trade-off!) this solution increases the logic and complexity on the user side of akka-io and requires everyone to implement this same stuff again.2. Fuse with    This could be done by extending to also allow off-heap (i.e. disk-based) content. ByteStrings already support compounding (i.e. copy-less ""concatenation"")", so theoretically a simple would suffice in akka-io. However, I\\\'m not sure ByteStrings really should be able to model off-heap data. IMO this would overload the ByteString abstraction. Another disadvantage over the solution proposed with this patch is that you wouldn\\\'t be able to request intermediate ACKs (e.g. after the second of 3 sub-writes has been completed).3. Model differently  The currently proposed model for compound writes certainly isn\\\'t the only one conceivable. One alternative could be something like:   case class Write(data: ByteString, ack: Event, next: WriteCommand) extends WriteCommand  case class WriteFile(data: ByteString, ack: Event, next: WriteCommand) extends WriteCommand  case object EmptyWrite extends WriteCommand  However, somehow the proposed model is currently the one we like best.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The performance of  (add to tail) is lower on a LinkedHashMap than on a simple linked list.2. The performance of append (merging the new  back) is likely lower on a LinkedHashMap as the hash buckets may need to be recalculated.3. The performance of natural removal during iteration in case of expectOnce is lower on a LinkedHashMap when compared to the simple linked list as you\'d just reassign pointers as opposed to re-calculating the hash bucket then clear the hash map and linked list references.4. The performance of a  will be better on a singly linked list if the entry is upfront  the linked list is small which is the case for workloads which generally remove the entries mostly in the same chronological order they were added (most of our use cases).The LinkedHashMap will break-even if the list is large AND  to the lower parts of the list are frequent.

The main reason that I wanted to explore this implementation was to see if the needs could be met by using an existing data structure in Scala\'s collections library.

The header has a special status in HTTP. It allows the client to send a header with the request headers and then pause request sending (i.e. hold back sending the request entity). The server reads the request headers, determines whether it wants to accept the request and responds with , if it doesn\\\'t support the expectation (or of the header contains other, unsupported expectations).a response," if it is ready to accept the request entity and the client should go ahead with sending ita final response (like a to signal some client-side error (e.g. if the request entity length is beyond the configured limit) or a redirect) Only if the client receives a response from the server is it allowed to continue sending the request entity. In this case it will receive _another_ response after having completed request sending.So this special feature breaks the normal ""one request one response"" logic of HTTP!It therefore requires special handling in all HTTP stacks (clientand server-side). For us this means:on the server-side:  After having read a header with the request we package up an instance and send it through to the application. Only when (and if) the application then requests data from the entity stream do we send out a response and continue reading the request entity. The application will therefore be able to itself determine whether it wants the client to send the request entity by deciding whether to look at the request entity data stream or not.on the client-side:  If the user adds a header to the request we need to hold back sending the entity until we\\\'ve received a response. As you can see implementing this feature requires some changes to the internal pipings of the serverand client-side HTTP stack"," especially the ""bypasses"".

akka,15799,closed,8,2014-09-04 08:15:59,1270.53,,,1,"b'b"" This is not 100% correct. 100-Continue is only an optimization technique", not a protocol constraint. It also doesn\'t really change the  semantics. Therefore the client _is actually allowed_ to send the entity even if it didn\'t get 100-Continue (and most clients do send the entity after the timeout passes). This is because some servers do not support Expect-Continue header and in such case, the client is encouraged to wait for a 100-Continue and if it doesn\'t receive it, it is allowed to continue anyway. The server must discard these data but it must not interpret the received data as new requests, unless it gets the last-chunk marker. Also, with, or without using 100-Continue, the client _must be prepared_ to get a final response from the server before it manages to finish sending the request entity. In this case it must stop sending the entity i.e. send the last chunk or disconnect (if not chunked). So 100-continue doesn\'t really change anything besides injecting additional time the client has to wait before sending the entity.It is amazing how many people got it wrong.

Your second point, that the incoming side should always be watched while sending the request, is somewhat unrelated to 100-continue support. Also, section 8.2.2 of RFC2616, which you quote," has somewhat changed in RFC 7230. It is now in [section 6.5]url  and reads:While the bit about terminating chunked requests prematurely upon reception of an error response probably still holds it doesn\'t appear to be explicitly suggested by the spec anymore.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Therefore it must either send the body (should be not full) or terminate the connection. This is to some degree not clear and often misinterpreted, but if the client gets the final error response instead of 100 Continue, it  MUST still finish the body part, either by sending it fully or at least the last chunk to somehow mark the end-of the message. If it wants to skip the body and it was not using chunked transfer encoding, it MUST disconnect. Immediate sending the next request on the same connection, without prior properly marking the end-of-body of the previous message is not allowed," because the server is still in the ""expects body"" state"," not the ""waiting for request"" state.  Many clients got the specs wrong", and that\\\'s why many servers actually always force Connection:close on any error response when expect-continue was in use.

So, firstly, is not appropriate for use here," as there typically no ""mapping"" between input websocket messages and output websocket messages", reactive maps is a good example, an input message updates the users location or viewport area, an output message updates the users viewed area periodically there is no map done. could be used, but this is awkward to integrate into an Akka application, again consider reactive maps, you can\\\'t directly subscribe an to a distributed pubsub actor, which reactive maps needs to do.  Instead you have to create an actor that would subscribe itself to the distributed pubsub actor and feed everything it receives into the somehow.  Since you\\\'re creating an actor anyway, why not have that actor just be the actor that handles the flow? So, the interface that I\\\'d like to see on is: The function would pass in the actor that the flow actor can use to send messages to, that actor would have the same contract as  , and it would return an actor that can be used to receive messages, that actor will have the same contract as the actor passed to  .  Note, give the contracts of these actors, back pressure is never propagated, but that\\\'s a natural consequence of using actors, and is not necessarily a bad thing for applications that have embraced the actor model, such as reactive maps. Note that the above can almost be implemented today on top of the Akka streams API, except that it requires an intermediate materialization, making it only possible to use it once: Perhaps the only additional thing here, is since the actor is being created by the method, it should also be automatically shutdown when the stream completes.\''

akka,16985,closed,12,2015-03-03 15:32:11,1061.25,,,1,"b'b"" One question though when interacting with  ", do you have to manage back pressure?  Or more to the point, if I don\'t want backpressure, but rather want a configurable strategy for what to do when buffers are full, is there a simple solution for me to use? The example use case is the one everyone always uses in WebSockets 101 a simple chat room.  In a chatroom, it\'s fine to drop the connection if the client doesn\'t consume messages fast enough, and if it\'s a problem, you can place a limit on the rate at which any one client can send messages, dropping the connection when they exceed that, so back pressure is not needed.  In , implementing a simple chat room is only a handful of lines of code: This makes for a great code example, it\'s very easy to understand, and when people want to evaluate what server they are going to use to provide their websockets, they\'re going to look at things like this to see how simple it is.  So what\'s our answer to that with Play using Akka streams (or Akka HTTP using Akka streams even)? The simplest I can come up with is this: Aside from being more lines of code, this has the following problems:You need to understand actor watching.You need to understand the semantically very complex and interfaces.You need to understand materialization, and why you need to pass a function to handle it in  There\'s a race condition where a user could send a message before they are in the list of users to receive a message ie, they won\'t receive their own messages this doesn\'t exist for the  solution.  Solving this, at my best effort, requires about another 30 or so lines of code, where you have to have another actor per user, and do some state management to buffer messages until you\'ve received the actor to send with.  This is probably the biggest problem with the above solution.  It\'s also a problem if you want to do any  processing on the WebSocket, since there\'s no association between the in and the out, and getting this association requires a similar solution to the above. So," does the new API make this very common and very simple use case for WebSockets simple to implement with Akka streams?  Or do we need to keep this [supplemental Akka streams API]url  in Play to provide it?""'",,,

""10000 concurrent users"" can mean a lot of different things. E.g. if you setup to use 10000 connections", it will try to create all those (persistent HTTP) connections but at the same time it already starts hammering the server with requests. Normally will be able to completely max out server CPU by sending just on 8 connections (or at least as many as CPUs are available) if handling the request is completely CPU-bound which is the usual benchmarking case.  Increasing the number of connections from this point will only mean that connection establishment and request handling will battle for resources which means that timeouts are likely. So, in summary, try to separate testing for performance (How many RPS are possible?) and scalability over connections (What is the performance impact of running requests over more connections?). From what I\\\'ve seen scalability is ok while performance still needs to be improved. /cc @sirthias\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The one where I can specify the backlog size as parameter has a lot of other parameters I have no clue about, what to pass here. @jrudolph you\'re right, that\'s why I provided the stress test setup with gatling in my example project, too. As you said, increasing the number of connections will end up in a battle for resources. But if you have to choose a technology, one can cope with that and answer the requests even if not very fast and the other refuses the connections because it\'s not able to manage the battle for resources, which one would you use? In a world with SLAs and zero downtime, answering a request with 150ms (which was the mean of spring boot in my comparison) compared to 40% connection refused, I would choose the first option ;) Don\'t get me wrong, I like akka and actor based programming, especially what it does to handle concurrency and resilience in a very concise way.

Alternatively, I can use the stream diff and a back pressure overflow strategy. Of course, if this is right, or reasonably right, sizing buffers like this doesn\'t seem appropriate as a general practice.

Another solution to support lasting network partitioning but yet not to reallocate all regions in case of coordinator actors relocation is to recover the coordinator data from the active node cache it sees and not from the persistent level. the coordinator data is not relevant in case all nodes are shutdown so it won\'t be a problem to start with empty state in the next cluster launch...""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Maybe that\\\'s what play needs to do if it wants to provide customized transparent HEAD request handling without piggy-backing on top of what akka-http provides.

As a user using a monitoring tool like e.g. [kamon]url  that reports requests (based on request method and path)", I\'d expect to see different traces for HEAD and GET requests. If there are lots of HEAD requests while I have no HEAD directive defined and GETs are expensive, I could decide to add an explicit  for HEAD.That\'s the use case where I\'m coming from," because we had seen unexpected behaviour / monitoring traces for transparent HEAD requests in play.

akka,18020,closed,10,2015-07-16 21:52:16,958.62,,,1,b'b\' @magro The reasoning behind this setting is that, when you don\\\'t switch it off," HEAD requests will automatically be dealt with without you having to do _anything_ in your routing layer. Your code simply sees GET requests and does what it needs to do to complete them.The HTTP layer determines whether the full response entity needs to be sent (in the case of real GET requests) or not (in the case of a ""fake"" GET request which really is a HEAD request). Of course you are right and it might be that some work is done that could be avoided when HEAD requests were handled explicitly by the application. However", in many cases this additional overhead doesn\\\'t really matter and people happily choose the convenience over the extra cycles. Note that with akka-http\\\'s streaming nature the extra work is in many cases less than it was with spray, since the response entity stream can be constructed fully lazily (i.e. only when the response entity stream is actually materialized), which the HTTP layer will not do in the case of a transparent HEAD request.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But perhaps because play does it like this I\'d expect to see which HTTP method was actually used for a request (e.g. to be able to have correct ). So I\'d expect that the  would be called (or some that includes  ), but with =  . Why shouldn\'t a user see only a GET request, and not that it was actually HEAD?I don\'t want to criticize this decision, I just want to understand the thinking behind it, because in play this is obviously different. Regarding : AFAICS the transparent HEAD request returns the Content-Length (I tried this [minimal-scala-akka-http-seed template]url  therefore I assume that the response body is fully constructed to determine this (and backend calls that are needed for the response body will be executed, which I\'d be more concerned about than the costs for sending the response body).

akka,18020,closed,12,2015-07-16 21:52:16,1433.57,,,1,"b'b\' @magro in Akka HTTP (and in spray) the low-level HTTP layer and the high-level routing layer are fully decoupled. It is completely normal for an application to only use the low-level layer (and implement its own ""routing"").The ""transparent head requests"" setting is a feature of the _low-level_ layer. As such there is no direct connection to the routing DSL. But you can very easily implement a ""transparent head requests"" feature with the routing DSL yourself", if you so want. (Of course you should disable the heading for the low-level layer for this to work.)This depends entirely on the application. If the Content-Length is easily known without constructing the entity (as for example in the case of file content) there is no need to load the entity before it is actually being sent. And if the Content-Length is not easily available the application could also decide to return a chunked entity. This too would make it easy to not load any entity content unnecessarily for HEAD requests. In general we are not saying that the setting is a perfect solution. It definitely has its weaknesses. But, since it has served us quite well over the last years with spray, we migrated it over to Akka HTTP.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On the surface it looks that way, but I think there\'s still a problem correctly builds a list of files matching the given sequence number and timestamp, but it then calls for each of these, which only takes into account the sequence number, just as you described. So in the case of multiple snapshots existing with the same sequence number, but different timestamps, they\'ll _all_ be deleted so yes, while the timestamp is initially taken into account, it ends up being ignored eventually. Also as far as I\'ve seen with  , sequence numbers are never incremented, so this problem is bound to occur when trying to delete all snapshots other than the latest for a given persistence ID.

In spray we used Akka IO\\\'s which delays reading the file and uses to read the file only in Akka IO. In that case, you have to rely on the acknowledgement to be sure that you can delete the file.

The use-case you described cannot be modeled by a single HTTP protocol exchange. The notion of ""emitting the entire data to the connection"" is not really useful. You cannot observe if the peer has received the complete data just by observing your side of the connection. You can observe some parts of the pipeline but there\\\'s still the send buffer on your side", the network, the receive buffer on the peer side, and the complete peer side application stack between your application logic and the peer\\\'s.

The suggested solution of accessing the materialized value during building a graph is still quite complicated and prone to race conditions.[x] The remote address of the peer is currently passed to the parser during creation," removing this obstacle would need a method to parameterize materialization. The suggested workaround of materializing a function or promise (or any kind of cell) to pass the value in _after_ materialization is again prone to race conditions (or would complicate the target stage with extra waiting code to receive the value).

This does not run anything, this is a description of the running thing. 2. Fusing. Fusing will traverse above graph, looking for demarcations of asynchronous boundaries, then rewires the graph fusing anything between asynch boundaries to a datastructure that is relevant only for synchronous islands.3. Materialization. Traverse the final graph and make it into a network of running RS-based entities. It is step 2 that is the most costly," 3 coming right after. The reason for the large upfront cost is cannot completely attributed to these steps though. The main reason for the current cost is that everything is treated as being a generic graph (with directed or undirected cycles or basically arbitrary structure). The reality is that most code only involves a few ""graphy"" parts", the rest is linear which could be handled much more efficiently. It is a long time plan to optimize the linear cases since we now removed all assumptions of non-graphiness from where it does not belong and hence it is now an internal optimization.

We send it over the control stream because remote deployment process depends on message ordering for DaemonMsgCreate and Watch messages. Immediately after sending DaemonMsgCreate we watch the remote ref", i.e. it must be created before Watch arrives. Watch is only sent over control stream, since it\'s a system message. The Decoder retries (with delay) the resolve of remote deployed refs if they can\'t be resolved immediately. The retries are only performed for the first message, thereafter the retry is banned. Next message will however still try to resolve once. It\'s only the retry mechanism that is banned for that ref to avoid head-of-the-line blocking in the Decoder in case someone sends to a terminated remote deployed ref. RemoteSystemDaemon is not a real actor, i.e. no async boundary. Meaning that ! DaemonMsgCreate will immediately create the remote deployed actor. _Problem_: There is an assumption in the Decoder that there are no asynchronous boundaries between its onPush and the RemoteSystemDaemon recipient, i.e. it will not process the Watch message before the actor is created by the RemoteSystemDaemon. When using multiple inbound lanes we have an async boundary here, the hub. _Solution_: The retry mechanism will mitigate the problem, but it can still happen. Not sure what we can do? The result would be that the resolve of the recipient for the Watch message would fail and trigger DeathWatchNotification. We could drop the Watch message in that case and it will be resent, but for how long? We also send DaemonMsgCreate over the ordinary message stream (all lanes) so that the first ordinary message that is sent to the ref does not arrive before the actor is created. _Problem_: When using multiple inbound lanes the DaemonMsgCreate and the first ordinary message may take different lanes and therefore arrive in wrong order. _Solution_: Duplicate the DaemonMsgCreate message in the inbound stream so that it is sent over all inbound lanes. That would work with current BroadcastHub + filter but would be complicated with future RouteHub. We perform deduplication of DaemonMsgCreate in the RemoteSystemDaemon," since we send copies of it over several streams.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So we thought akka\'s queue was growing b/c it there\'s no remote connectivity and thus isn\'t draining it.

This is how it works roughly: url This means that a connection never timed out on missed heartbeats, but that implies that the connection was not really broken.  It should also log if this internal queue grows too large: url No, the usual reason we see if the remoting is overwhelmed, hence did we put that log statement in there. These messages can also pile up in mailbox which is the other usual culprit.

We are also using Akka typed fully in production for the past 6 months but I may have missed a different pattern that may exist to do this, please point it out if I did.  ### The problem  I find it quite annoying to use the adapter every time I want to access the event stream. The use cases I find the event stream useful is mostly for monitoring and testing purposes. I think it would be worth to at least make it type safe by adding a helper method to the actor system, something like.  and  The disadvantage of this is adding two more methods to the typed actor system interface so another approach would be to have something like Which would be a wrapper actor around the event stream implementation. or even something like which would just be a simple class wrapping the untyped event stream and providing the subscribe and publish methods above.

The proper test of whether backpressure exists or not depends only on observing unbounded behavior (or a double-push", but that throws an exception).

As you pointed out the async boundary will detach the stages. Testing backpressure seems quite tricky. Not sure how to do it correctly on a single non-detached stage without taking into account the buffering in the boundary.  I think you\'re right. The real problem here is that I am somewhat relying on there being no buffering. Part of this stems from a downstream problem which I will go back and rethink.

I\\\'d say it is somewhat unexpected that there is data in input buffers when the idle timeout triggers because the application should have had 10 seconds time to read that data. But as you say under high load it may happen.  So, without having looked into it any deeper, we need to:  * Decide what an idle-timeout should mean for higher-level stages. So far," I considered it basically the same as a connection error (e.g. like ""connection reset by peer""). Which would mean that it is expected that some buffers are dropped.  * In TLSActor", treat the idle-timeout like a connection error, which would mean that it is fine to drop buffers. We should send an error out to the user stream when that happens (which doesn\\\'t seem to be the case for some reason).  * In HTTP, make sure that errors are actually delivered and not stuck in buffers.

We use this entry-point in akka-http (but don\'t make use of the now removed-again feature). We might just accept the backwards breaking change in 2.5 (with the reasoning that this entry-point was little used outside of akka-http). However", even then," we need to backport the new API to 2.4 to make sure we can still build akka-http against Akka 2.4 and 2.5 from the same source tree.

akka,23600,closed,body,2017-09-05 11:08:39,00:00,,1,,b'b\' Hi,  We use Akka for many of our  and run them in Kubernetes, passing in environment-related information (host names, etc.) via environment variables. Many of these applications use akka-cluster and akka-persistence-cassandra, both of which require a list of nodes as part of their configuration. However, there is no way to pass these via environment variables, so we have to add code that manually parses the environment variable, creates a Config that only contains that, and falls back on the actual config file. (The suggested workaround is using system properties, but that doesn\\\'t really fit well with the way we run our applications)  This is not ideal for a couple of reasons: It divides the config to separate places, instead of everything being contained in 1 file. It\\\'s basically the same code, duplicated for every env variable / config setting we care about. Now, this issue has been raised [several]url  [times]url  in Typesafe Config (even by @patriknw [once]url  and there is even a [merged PR]url  to support passing lists via environment variables, but the library hasn\\\'t had a release in about a year, and there\\\'s no mention of when and if there will be a new one.  I think there are a couple of ways this issue can be handled:  1. A new release of Typesafe Config. This would be ideal, but I\\\'m not sure  have the resources for this. 2. Allow these kinds of list properties in Akka (I don\\\'t know if there are others, but I assume so) to be configured via a string as well. For example," checking if the ""seed-nodes"" config exists"," and if not falling back to parsing ""seed-nodes-str"" (or vice-versa). This would add some ugliness to the Akka codebase", but it will solve the problem without having to wait for Config. (And I don\\\'t mind making a PR for this, so it doesn\\\'t even require much resources from Lightbend).\'',,,,,,

I\\\'m not sure there\\\'s an action to be taken right now; With JDK9 coming out *tomorrow*, we should rather look forward and investigate that Pool\\\'s performance for our use case (AFAIR it exposes a flat about spinning that we needed).  Having that said, we\\\'ll revisit this topic naturally sooner or later and I\\\'d like to propose closing this issue, as there is not immediate action to resolve it at least not in the form as has been stated here.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,

I agree that we agree with each other :smile: it is how it is right now.  Side note: The funny thing is if akka switches to JDK\'s (post 8) FJP someday"," then  will become the default behaviour inside Play action methods. (However I think to be aware of this behaviour is an app-developer\'s responsibility anyway  should understand in which context a  will run). Nevertheless I think removing akka\'s custom FJP and switching to the JDK 9 FJP if performance goals are meet is the way to go in long term.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Currently, sharded actors don\'t have access to their entity identifier. The example in the docs uses  , but that is URL-encoded and not the actual ID. On top of that, this seems to be an implementation detail the encoded ID happens to be what the shard uses for the actor name. At the same time, it is obvious that adding an method is not a good solution (actors don\'t know whether or not they\'re sharded).  So I suggest modifying the (or adding another API next to it) so that instead of taking as a parameter, it would take a function that would get invoked with the entity ID. What do you think?

Just a thought: it may be worthwhile introducing an method level annotation which tells akka that this method should be configured to be called when a message of it\'s parameter type is received.  In other words", we could have something like  When the Actor starts up, it scans through it\'s methods and when it encounters such a method, it automatically configures it via the ReceiveBuilder (ie  )  If more than one parameter is setup in the method, or there is multiple methods with the same parameter type, an exception is thrown.  This has 3 benefits :  1. It removes the boiler plate code for configuring the builder 2. When looking at an Actor class, we can easily identify which methods are used for message callbacks (really useful when an actor class grows in size) 3. When working with a Actor subtypes," this will greatly simplify the API by not having to expose the builder to different levels of the hierachy.  Hope this makes sense Daniel  ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This is for pure efficiency on performance sensitive platforms."" Looking at the Aeron source there are lots of mentions of endianness in  there", but also things like this:  which suggests that the code isn\\\'t properly endian-independent yet.

akka,24838,closed,1,2018-04-03 08:52:42,84.73,1,,,"b'b"" Just to sum up after looking at it for a bit: The thread local usage is exactly the same as done in the ForkJoinPool in the JDK", and is used to shard threads posting work to the internal queues in the FJP.  Inside of Akka there are in general few threads, and those are stopped when the actor system is shut down, so those leaked  s would be released, then what is left is external threads interacting with the FJP.  The issue here is then that the class is kept in memory by the thread, which likely keeps the entire class loader from being garbage collected. And as every non-forked test run in sbt will probably load the class anew, that is one set of all classes per test run.  I\'m not sure we can fix this in the FJP, for two reasons:  1. We\'d have to keep a list of all threads that ever posted work the the FJP (and keep those cleaned up) to be able to do it. 2. As it is, it is pretty much a verbatim copy of the Java 8 FJP (which we added to work around a performance degradation in the Java 9 one), and I\'m not sure we want to have it diverge from the original Java 8 class.  It could perhaps be possible to add some workaround in the sbt project though, if you can somehow hook into sbt," iterate over the threads still left alive after a test has completed and clear that thread local. Or if it would somehow be possible to make sure sbt ran the test in a thread that is stopped when done.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

On JDK9+, in theory the resulting jar would work on Java 8 by simply passing to scalac and to javac. Unfortunately, is not available for the Scala 2.11 scalac, and restricts the use of which we still use here and there.  For this reason, at least when building on JDK9+, we need to specifically set the Java bootclasspath to the one from the JDK8 installation.

It\'s a good idea to provide helpers to configure ssl but it\'s not a good idea to make that a dependency everywhere (because providing an SSLContext / SSLSession should mostly suffice).  Now we have the problem that akka and akka-http depend on ssl-config and we cannot easily change that any more.  We should at least make sure that the binary incompatibilities don\'t affect -http directly (it doesn\'t seem to be the case from the output you posted above). I guess the remaining incompatibilities would mostly affect third-party libraries that depend on ssl-config but I find it unlikely that there would be many of those.

akka,26192,closed,body,2019-01-03 08:27:46,00:00,,1,,"b""b' There are quite a few connectors in Alpakka where the implementation needs access to a Materializer", Actor System or Attributes. These are currently exposed to custom GraphStages but are not easily available for simple Sources Flows or Sinks.  For example the S3 connector uses akka-http therefore it needs access to Actor System. It also has some inner flows that are run in the implementation for which it needs access to Materializer.  Current S3 connector takes these resources as parameters in the factory methods. However that makes created Sources Flows or Sinks not freely sharable because they are tied to a particular Actor System or Materializer.  We have a [WIP Alpakka PR]url  which exposes Materializer to arbitrary Source Flow or Sink. Here is how the typical S3 factory looks like currently:   First user needs to instantiate giving the  , and as parameters. Then instance of can be used to create Source Flow and Sinks, which are tied to these parameters.  After the refactoring in the before mentioned PR, factories are converted to be real static factories:   The implementation of after the refactoring uses to expose the Materializer:   This approach has two downsides: * materialized value is wrapped into a   * does not materialize the inner Sink if the stream does not emit an element. This is a problem in the S3 upload use-case where creating an empty file, which is encoded by a  , is supported.  This ticket is about discussing a supported way to expose Materializer.  One approach would be to modify the traversal logic and add a possibility to expose Materializer which would make it possible to materialize factories of  .  Another approach would be to implement a custom that would wrap the Source Flow or Sink and provide Materializer and Attributes," since these are already available to the implementation of custom Graph Stages. However materialized value of the inner Source Flow or Sink would still be wrapped into a using this approach.  Let me know what you think.'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
