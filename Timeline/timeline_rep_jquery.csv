There are other forms of JSONP for POST requests that involve iframes, but they require the target to return code to communicate with the parent page via or  , so an auto-replaced callback would not be required there. Ultimately this is a serious bug for many modern webapps that use jQuery to post JSON data to persist data via REST-based services," so I hope it gets merged and rolled into the next release as soon as possible.

jquery,371,closed,2,2011-05-05 00:36:13,305.6,,1,,b'b\' Yeah, I\\\'ll give you two answers. First one in code, second one an explanation of the theory behind what we\\\'re doing. It\\\'s a little long, sorry. First, here is my overly simple code example: ===A Script Loader===$.include = function(script){  $.holdReady(true);  add_script_to_document_and_call_function_when_loaded(    script,"    function(){$.holdReady(false);}  );} ===A Response From The Server===...   $.include(""/"");  $(function(){    // The expectation is that this code will not be executed until after  has been loaded    $(""#widget51"").mywidget({foo: ""bar""});  });  ... The above works fine so long as this is the original page load (I.E. the ready event hasn\\\'t already fired.) With a vanilla jQuery 1.6 however", it will fail on an ajax request. In other words," the following is likely to give intermittent ""mywidget is not a function"" errors: $(""#content"").html($.get(""/"")); The errors happen because ""ready"" always lets everything through after the document has loaded", even if  hasn\\\'t downloaded yet. The holdReady() event is ignored in the AJAX case. This is the documented behavior, but it isn\\\'t very helpful. My patch makes this work in both cases, by allowing holdReady() to restart the deferring process at any time. #  The long answer is more about theory and architecture, not just on the client side, but also the server side. There are several competing needs that any web developer usually wants to balance:1. Keeping the code modular. Individual components should be self contained," and should be able to operate without sprinkling dependencies elsewhere.2. Minimizing the number of script files that need to be sucked down for any single request.3. Maximizing the value of the cache for script files.4. Keeping code organized. Separate things in separate files.5. Keeping development easy. ""out of flow"" things (like having to ""rebuild"" stuff each time you change a file) are painful. JavaScript isn\\\'t especially well suited to some of these needs. Code organization and the ability to keep server side code modular are especially large problems. Code organization needs generally conflict with minimizing the number of files sucked down. And so on. The dark horse here is actually item 1", modularity. The moment you start mixing your AJAX with any extensive widgetization it comes to bite you HARD. The livequery paradigm is one way people try to solve this, but that has some undesirable traits, and it leaves large portions of the issue unresolved. The largest part of the modularity problem is ensuring that the proper files are available when needed, but no earlier (We don\\\'t want to suck down everything we have, just because an ajax request might return something that needs it.) In the end, for any sort of complex application, a script loader becomes a highly desirable tool. With a good script loader you can ensure that all necessary files are available, while guaranteeing that each file is only loaded a single time (important, since double loading could create bugs). A script loader also opens possibilities for organization of code across separate files, because the files themselves can become responsible for the inclusion of their own external dependencies (Like a WYSIWYG editor, which might require a document range abstraction layer, a json encoder, a gallery plugin, and a cookier plugin). So, assuming that we use a script loader, take a look back at the server. A request comes in, and needs to return something: let\\\'s say a complex form with some custom widgets. The view helpers each build a bit of markup for their widgets. Part of the widget markup is a script element that a) uses $.include (our script loader) to guarantee that the required resources are present, and b) uses $(document).ready(function(){...}) to perform any necessary jQuery operations on the newly created widget, once all the resources are known to be present. The desire is for this widget markup to always works exactly the same way, regardless of whether it was used in the initial page load, or in an AJAX request. If we can do that, the other problems are resolved. The relevant script files never have to be included in a large header monolith, so the initial page load is snappy, and the server side code is clean an modular. The cache value is maximized, no script build phase is needed for development," there is no large wasteful collection of livequery declarations because ""we need this sometimes"". In order for this bit of magic to work though", the $(document).ready() bits in the response have to be able to work AFTER the ready event has already fired once. The nuance here is that in the mind of the typical developer," $(document).ready() doesn\\\'t actually mean ""do this when the document has fired it\\\'s on load event"". The native load event is such a mess", nobody wants to think about it anymore. That\\\'s why jQuery wraps it up in a neat little package. Now we just dump everything in $(document).ready(), and when we do that," we mean ""do this as soon as it is safe to run my stuff."" The fact that the server responded with new script requirements that have not been loaded"," means that it is no longer ""ready"" or ""safe"" to execute new scripts", until after it resolves those requirements. The script loader calls $.holdReady(true), just as it does when loading scripts during the page load. The only difference now is that it was an AJAX request, not a page load, but again," the developer doesn\\\'t want to have to care. The intent is still the same: ""do this stuff whenever it is safe"". The expectation is that execution of any $(document).ready() blocks will always be delayed as appropriate. Once the requirements are loaded", execution continues. This change makes robust script loaders possible, and clears the path for web development paradigms that blur the lines between AJAX and page loads (making the ajaxification of previously static web apps almost trivial.) Without this, any script loader is crippled, because it can\\\'t be safely and easily used with AJAX (a major use case). The addition of holdReady() in 1.6 is a major step in the right direction, and this patch continues that by moving it into the AJAX realm.\''
jquery,371,closed,3,2011-05-05 00:36:13,1246.58,1,,,b'b\' The argumentation pro holdReady are so wrong on so many levels. ## this breaks code independance There is nothing modular about having a script loader delaying the ready event: on the contrary, you give any module in your application the means to derail the semantics of the dom ready event and take the risk of breaking other portions of your app relying on said event. In your very sample module, if the ajax request fails, then all modules that rely on dom readyness and are loaded after said module (or even before if dom readyness hasn\\\'t been notified yet) will just plain stop working. Now that\\\'s modularity for you! That\\\'s how dangerous," inconsistent and pointless this ""feature"" is. It makes non-dependant modules loading order important while it shouldn\\\'t be: you don\\\'t always load interdependant modules", sometimes you do have separate and independant portions in your app (at least if you\\\'re not doing it wrong). If some remote resource is temporarily unavailable, say the Twitter Data API you only use for a little tweeting widget in the sidebar," do you really want your page as a whole to become unusable because no dom readyness bound function will be called? Is this really the kind of approach we want to promote? ## we\\\'re breaking jQuery for ""convenience"""," promoting bad practice in the process Having a bunch of ""master"" scripts that will block any other module from being loaded should be done within the script loaders themselves. Let them provide a means to add a ""global"" script and not load  execute modules before those ""master"" scripts are loaded. Is it so hard to code that we need to break jQuery for this? Why should other code in the page that do not make use of the script loader be penalized or plain broken to save a few bytes in the script loader? Beside", how do I go about making jQuery itself a global include, seeing as I obviously don\\\'t have holdReady available at that point? Make an incantation? Nope, you have to use a script tag for this," just as you should for any global script in your app. If you truly want a script to become ""part of the environment"" (like the script loader itself btw)", then that\\\'s the way to go. It\\\'s easy enough to check script tags in your  server-side when running your build script that will deliver this fancy all-in-one-file minified js. Even worse," how can one promote ""global"" scripts includes as ""more modular"" or ""better organized"". Take nodejs", for instance: in every single js file, you **have** to require all the libs you use in your file. Nobody\\\'s complaining about it because it actually makes sense. Global includes are frown upon in any environment I know of and for good reason (they\\\'re only available using command-line arguments for the compilers of all languages I used so far, that should tell people something). Having to specify all you dependencies for a module is not an inconvenience," it\\\'s what makes your system truly modular in the first place: you can take your module as is and drop it into any other  and it\\\'ll just work. If you use ""global includes""", then you have to copy parts of the environment configuration with it. Talk about maintenance hell. ## it makes jQuery\\\'s dom readyness notification unreliable The dom ready event has specific semantics and is **not** some kind of synchronization utility to be meddled with just because it\\\'s convenient to a niche. I\\\'m appalled enough that we have holdReady in the first place... but that we try and break things even more by making it work post dom readyness is beyond me. This has bad practice painted all over the place for reasons I already explained before. With holdReady in place, I, as a  developper cannot trust jQuery to properly notify dom readyness. So, in short, I\\\'ll duplicate the dom readyness logic in my own code and never use the $( fn ) signature ever again since any third party can meddle with its behaviour without my knowledge. We\\\'re talking self-deprecation here. ## you can easily join one or several ajax requests with dom readyness I also don\\\'t understand why some people keep on implying it\\\'s difficult to sync on ajax requests **and** dom readyness, all you need is a dom readyness Promise and a construct as follows: Funily enough, even if jQuery doesn\\\'t provide domReadyPromise, you can create it pretty easily: This solution doesn\\\'t meddle with the dom ready event and, as a consequence, doesn\\\'t spit all over any other code in your application: a problematic ajax request won\\\'t break surrounding .\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jquery,371,closed,4,2011-05-05 00:36:13,1406.8,,,1,b'b\' @jauborg, This really isn\\\'t the place to start a fight over whether holdReady() itself is an acceptable feature. holdReady is here, and there are a handful of very important use cases for it. Before holdReady was added," it really wasn\\\'t possible to write a decent script loader without hacking the core. (By ""decent"" I mean one that would allow you to replace every script tag with a call to the script loader", and have everything continue to work like it did before.) Some quick thoughts on some of your specific complaints: **Code Independence**: In a vanilla web page everything already has to wait for every script file to be sucked down and processed, regardless of which snippets require which scripts. This isn\\\'t any different. **Nothing modular about...**: Modularity comes (in part) from being able to delay loading of secondary scripts until they are actually needed, avoiding minified monoliths. The modularity empowered by this is on the _server_ side, not the client side. **Failed AJAX Request example**: This is a bug in your theoretical code, not a problem with the holdReady concept. Correctly written code would use the completed  success+error callback(s) to clear the hold. Additionally," someone would have to be soft in the head to hold the ready event just because they are waiting for data from Twitter. That\\\'s not what this is for. **""Let [the script loaders] provide a means to add a ""global"" script""**: This isn\\\'t DRY. Any time you are waiting for the document to have been loaded", you pretty much need to have assurances that the scripts are ready. The generic dom ready event was originally designed to give this assurance, holdReady allows script loaders to continue to offer that assurance," even though the internal dom ready event hangs you out to dry when a script loader is used. **""you should [use a script tag] for any global script in your app""**: Um. Wow. You really have no idea why a script loader would ever be needed", do you? I\\\'m not entirely sure how to respond to this. Do you do server side development? PHP? Imagine what it would be like to develop a complex application if PHP didn\\\'t have an include or require," or if  didn\\\'t wait for the file to be included before continuing execution. **""fancy all-in-one-file minified js""**: I reject the fancy all-in-one minified js. Although this is better than serially loading individual files", it is far from ideal. You are delaying the first page load to suck down every drop of script that the application will ever have to use, even though 90% of it won\\\'t get used at all (or at least not until much later). Complex systems will have _worse_ page load times site wide due to the massive amount of script that has to be processed on every page load," even though it isn\\\'t needed. A good script loader offers much better alternatives. **""it makes jQuery\\\'s dom readyness notification unreliable""**: It never was ""reliable"". If you use $(fn) after dom ready has fired", your function will be called, even though dom ready is not firing at that moment. If you **really** need the dom ready event, bind directly to the dom ready event at the low level. It is highly unlikely that you will ever actually need this, but if you do," you have options. **""any third party can meddle with its behaviour without my knowledge""**: Not every developer is a raging idiot", and if they are, you don\\\'t want their code on your site for reasons that go far beyond whether they abused holdReady. If you are really that worried about it," you could add to your code. **""you can easily join one or several ajax requests with dom readyness""**: Your proposed code doesn\\\'t solve remotely the same problem. Look at this again after you start lusting for a good script loader", and I expect you\\\'ll see what the real issue is. \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jquery,371,closed,15,2011-05-05 00:36:13,59.52,1,,,b'b\' Yes it is, especially given you\\\'re attempting to turn it into something even worse than what it is now.Wrong, you can use **async** or **defer** on your script tags. But that\\\'s beside the point: the gist of your argument is pro script loader not pro holdReady.No [Modularity]url  is about code independance and re-usability, and global includes break both. When you need to make sure several modules are included using a nice shorthand then you create a _new_ module that does all said includes then include this module... just like you would server-side. This makes it easy and straight-forward to track down dependencies when you need to use the same module elsewhere.No it was a bug in **your** theoretical code," that\\\'s the thing here. Your description of the code clearly states ""when it is loaded"": please read yourself careful. This kind of coding error happens far too often and _is to be expected_ with something as haskish as holdReady. As for the Twitter example", as contrived as it may seem, if you get into the habit of adding includes globally and use holdReady together with dom readyness as your synchronization means," then you will end up with problems like this faster than you can say ""soft in the head"". Some of the bugs we encounter in jQuery itself are quite dumb", yet only occur is such specific conditions they were nearly impossible to predict. Let something like holdReady lose in the API and see how it goes. When I see people doing it wrong with some very straight-forward things, I don\\\'t feel like putting a gun in their hands. Also, with a non-trivial application, with more than a single module and developper, tracking the problem will be a nightmare: it won\\\'t throw an exception, it won\\\'t notify anything," it just won\\\'t do a thing. I do appreciate you saying ""That\\\'s not what it is for"" because that\\\'s exactly my point regarding $( fn ) not being for anything else than dom readyness detection. Maybe you\\\'re starting to appreciate what I\\\'m talking about here?Don\\\'t Repeat **Yourself** doesn\\\'t mean ""Patch Someone Else\\\'s Work To Death Until It Does What I Want It To"" nor ""Dump What You Don\\\'t Wanna Code On Someone Else\\\'s Shoulders"". And you still confuse dom readyness and page load events. The dom ready event will fire as soon as the dom is ready for manipulation not when everything is loaded and processed... hence why you can use ""async"" on script tags", just like the latest snippets from google analytics do (in order not to  the dom readyness event **hint hint**).Again, you\\\'re missing the point and arguing pro script loader, not pro holdReady. **If** you want some scripts to delay the dom readyness event **then** you use a script tag without async nor defer. It\\\'s easy enough to code a solution for this server-side (and that\\\'s coming from someone who does a **lot** of server-side coding, in PHP and node): use a proper templating system. Of course, the real issue comes right in your face when you choose this road: you have two sets of dependencies per module, one of which is not in -side. Re-using a module becomes an excercise in information retrieval. This is sadly the very problem you intend to bring client-side with global includes (two sets of dependencies), except you shadow the issue and make it impossible to properly track said dependencies and make script loader agnostic code suffer your hastyness. That\\\'s actually where script loaders should help: remove global includes altogether and make dependency management a non-issue. Let\\\'s look at how one would implement an asynchronous require server-side just to see how it would look. Would you expose a global method to delay some kind of global event? Of course not, because **it wouldn\\\'t make sense, would break existing code or, worse, necessitate that you rewrite all your existing modules** (which is exactly what you\\\'re advocating for client-side here, whether you realize it or not). No, the solution is very simple indeed: you keep track of asynchronous requires inside of the module code itself and don\\\'t consider the main module as loaded as long as those internal dependencies are pending: If you ever need to do something asynchronous that is not about requiring a module (an ajax request for instance), than you provide an hold facility that is **local and specific to the module itself**: If you never call the releaseHold callback, then you only block the module itself and code that depends on it, **not the entire application**. If your script loader doesn\\\'t provide such a facility," then you have a feature enhancement request to open **in the script loader\\\'s bug tracker**. You don\\\'t hack poor jQuery away just because it\\\'s ""convenient"" and we\\\'re softies that like to please (and _that_ we are).See? We can agree on something. Note that the  solution I talked about in the previous question makes it easier for a server-side builder to parse and determine what needs to be loaded right away and what doesn\\\'t. Though the parser is non-trivial", mind you.Confusion again. **It was**. We have the dom ready event... then we have the dom readyness facility in jQuery: these are **not** the same. As of 1.5, $( fn ) is implemented using a Deferred internally and contract is this deferred will be resolved as soon as possible, that is as soon as the dom ready event is fired. holdReady will break this and, even worse," make it possible for ""as soon as possible"" to become ""never"" much too easily.I am a raging idiot", you are a raging idiot. Hell," we\\\'re all bloody morons when it comes to coding. And supposing there were ""smart"" coders in this world", everyone does not have the luxury to choose who or what they work with.I use script loaders (labJS, requireJS or yepnope, depending on the project\\\'s specific needs) daily and I even wrote two (well the second one I\\\'m  right now). I wrote them to understand what the limitations were, especially client-side, and to provide some facilities I needed in real-life applications. I can tell you it gave me quite a good perspective on them. Perspective is key here and is what you\\\'re lacking in my humble opinion. As soon as I investigated what it would take to make an asynchronous  manager, the first thing I implemented was a mean to wait for internal dependencies  define modules as a collection of dependencies (even full fledged dependency expressions in _dominoes_). If you have these facilities in a script loader (and, to my knownledge, most provide something related to a certain extend)," then you **do** have everything you need. If you still feel like hacking into jQuery\\\'s dom readyness system then you\\\'re obviously doing it **very very** wrong:it makes jQuery a ""system"" dependency", so you are forced to put jQuery in a non-async script tag in your HTML code: what if a page does not need jQuery? You got it, you need to deal with the problem server-side which is exactly the thing you frown upon,you refuse or don\\\'t know how to use some advanced facilities in your script loader, worse, your script loader doesn\\\'t provide the tools _you_ need for a _specific_ application: change of script loader (they\\\'re not all done for the same purpose: some are plain JS loaders," others dependency managers and others full-fledged modularization systems). Food for thought: what if the module you load doesn\\\'t make any dom manipulation (like underscore)? What is the meaning of this module waiting for the dom to be ready? **None**. That\\\'s how ""sound"" this whole mess of an idea holdReady actually is.\''",,
jquery,371,closed,16,2011-05-05 00:36:13,446.73,,1,,b'b\' @dmethvin," I understand your concern with the possibility of not staying ready. I guess that is sort of my point. The developer has been made two conflicting promises. The first is that ""inside $.ready"," all scripts are loaded"" (this is implicit in the dom ready event"," or enforced via $.holdReady by a compatible script loader). The second is that ""$.ready stays ready""", which is part of the purpose of the abstraction. This is fine until $.require gets called later; then you have a conflict. Do you continue to run $.ready callbacks, even though some scripts are now not loaded? Or do you wait for the new scripts to load before continuing? My vote is for the latter, because it honors the spirit of both needs. The developer who uses $.ready(...) has already explicitly decided to run the script later if needed, to ensure that everything is ready before the script runs. The developer still has a guarantee that the script will always run, and also has the guarantee that any previously included scripts were loaded. @rwldrn," The need for pausing the ready event after a completed load isn\\\'t obvious until you consider the server side. You mentioned seeking ""well known implementations with proven use cases""", so I\\\'ll use Zend Framework to describe the situation.1. Consider a Zend Framework based app2. Include jQuery (but not jQuery UI) on the page3. $.load a view that uses one of the jQuery view helpers4. It won\\\'t work. These helpers manage their own dependencies, and will attempt to add the needed script, but it doesn\\\'t work when the request is AJAX based (even if a script loader is used, because the Zend Framework code, like most similar code," is using $.ready for it\\\'s ""all scripts are loaded"" merits", and that isn\\\'t honored for asynchronously loaded content). This is a recurring problem for server side development of applications in AJAX heavy systems, and presents a serious barrier to AJAX, especially in existing code. @jaubourg, I\\\'m pro _this patch_, which mostly makes sense relative to script loaders used in content returned via AJAX; I\\\'m not going to fight with you about holdReady itself.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Animations contain an array of Tweens that will be updated when their function is called.## New hook points### Pre-filters allow a plugin to look at the and of an animation being created and overide some default functionality, or do something else entirely with it. The hide / show special case preFilter in the code is a good example.  It creates its own tweens for the hide and show scope to retain access to in the callbacks it attaches to hook all of timmy\\\'s goodness together.  Pre-filters are allowed to return their own object so long as it implements  , and  . will be none the wiser.### Allows you to peek at the  combinations and decide how to create a tween for that property or value.

I wrote include_ to do just that, and so if it doesn\'t, that\'s a bug. To summarize:1. () doesn\'t work for the tests that involve async jQuery load.2. include_ will include the correct built version you specify.3.

That way:iframes can easily inspect this variable and  a script element to load the exact same build the ready test can use the same variable to know which build to dynamically load We\'re about to ask a lot more from TestSwarm:build the project using grunt,test for all our builds and probably, later, combinations (build without ajax + ajax with a plugin) so there is more to this whole refactoring of how we include the library in the test suite than meets the eye and we need to think things through in and out. Namely, removing the modules\' closures and not supporting testing without a local server are not good enough reasons to get rid of the include script altogether, it just simplifies greatly what it has to do (which can be done 100% client-side).

jquery,886,closed,body,2012-08-08 20:38:51,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" # Clearing a Cloned Element\'s Style Causes the Original Element\'s Style to be Cleared## Introduction In IE9 and IE10 you can run into the situation when clearing ( ) a cloned element\'s style will also clear out the original element\'s corresponding style. The actual [jQuery Core Ticket #8908]url  isolates the bug when using the background-image style.  While I was trying to recreate and research this issue I had a feeling that there may be other styles that have the same issue", so I\'ve created a [test suite]url  checking [252 CSS1-3 styles]url  and testing various assertions.  Along the way, I also found some additional inconsistencies. These findings are technically unrelated to the #8908 issue so I will list those inconsistencies somewhere else and we can discuss those later.### Source Element\'s Style Cleared When Cloned Element\'s Style Cleared### IE9 & IE10 After testing 252 various styles only the following 8 ended up being problematic.background-attachmentbackground-colorbackground-imagebackground-positionbackground-repeatbackground-clipbackground-originbackground-size### IE 6/7/8, Chrome, Firefox, Opera Thankfully these browsers did not have the problem described in this issue when tested.## Proposed Solutions### 1. Use Default Values when Trying to Empty Style The following fix resolves the weird issue by substituting and empty string with it\'s default value. An object is used to store the style name and associated default value. If the value happens to be an empty string then it will look in the object for a matching key and if there is a match it will use that instead. #### ProsThis is very explicit in describing which styles are problematic in IE#### ConsThere is extra code executed when clearing the style for a nonIE browser. This could be a problem because updating a style via the method is very commonThere is a considerable amount of code to account for all problematic styles and this will bloat the jQuery source### 2. Strange Side Effect That Breaks the Clone Connection This solution is a little more strange and not so obvious. I ran into this fix as I was building up my unit tests and asserting a bunch of things I thought should be true. One of those assertions was verifying that when setting a style using the method that it actually worked. So, I used the getter (  method, but by doing so I found the problem going away just by calling the getter! And with that the following solution came about. You may notice a slightly strange piece of code  , but that was needed to get around an Opera bug I had when working with XML nodes. Technically I could have made the whole fix into one statement, but the minification process does a decent job of squishing down the fix to look like  .   #### ProsThe amount of code for this fix is relatively smallThis code is limited to the clone execution path, which happens infrequently when compared to the method approach in option #1.#### ConsThis relies on a weird quirk in IE9/10 to get around the problem, but it seems to be the most succinct. ### 3. Have IE9 & IE10 Fix this Bug It would be ideal if no patch had to be made to jQuery at all and IE9 and IE10 could apply a fix instead. Seeing that the issue is found in IE9 though may rule out this option entirely. #### ProsNo patch for jQuery would be needed#### ConsEven if the bug was fixed immediately for IE9 & IE10 there would still be an issue with versions of IE9 that didn\'t have the IE fix.## Unit Test The following Unit Test exposes the problem in IE9 and IE10. In browsers that don\'t support these styles I am skipping over them and asserting that they are not an issue. ## Conclusion Based on the research I have done testing 252 CSS styles I have isolated this issue to only 8 styles in IE9 and IE10.  I\'ve recommended solving this issue 3 different ways," but in the end _the 2nd option seems best to me_ since it only is executed in the clone execution path and is significantly smaller than the 1st option. The 3rd option of having IE fix this issue seems too late since the issue also affects IE9.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So," I had to add the following code in the method of the file to fix that outlier. ## Browsers Tested I have run the above changes through the following browsers ## WindowsChrome 22Firefox 15.0IE 10/9/8/7/6Opera 12.5Safari 5.1/5.0/4.0 ## MacChrome 20.0Firefox 14.0Opera 12/11.6/11.1Safari 5.1/5.0/4.0 ## Unit Test Changes As I was testing the code in all the above browsers I added another assertion to the Unit Test to check if the style that was being cleared on the clone element was indeed being reset. Because of that addition assertion I made the following changes...Added a unit test to verify that the clone was indeed reset correctlyAdd the value to match the backgroundColor for Opera 11.1When a background-image is cleared in Firefox it sets the value to the full image path that it is inheriting Added the value to match the backgroundPosition for Firefox 5.0Switched background-clip to because Safari 5.0 doesn\'t support that value  # Summary of ChangesI added the check and used it before the to limit when a call to occurs (IE9 / 10)I had to add another fix in the method to fix the style that wasn\'t fixed by the above. This code path is also limited by the check.I added another assertion to the Unit Test to verify that clearing out the style indeed resets it to an expected default value.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What I\\\'m saying is that, when you cannot even trust standard methods to be implemented correctly, you\\\'re probably better off not making any inference in your code, period. It\\\'s not about the browsers that jQuery supports today, it\\\'s about the ones it will have to support tomorrow (FF & Chrome are very aggressive and very breaking in that department). Everytime we release a new version, we hope for it to be the latest in it\\\'s 1.x branch. If such is the case, then some sites will have this version for a looooong time (1.4.4 anyone?). Now, comes along a browser that does break a single assumption... Feature detection should be as bullet proof as humanly possible (as in testing for the exact blank the workaround is supposed to fill), feature inference should be avoided at all cost, since it doesn\\\'t test for the blank itself and, thus, is just browser sniffing in disguise," even if it actually sniffs a large range of browsers: ""this is true"," and in every browser I know I can deduce this totally unrelated thing is true too so it will always be true no matter what"". I find it sad that we could actually feature detect here but just refuse to do so because ""we know of no browser that would break the assumption"" or ""it saves 4 bytes"". That doesn\\\'t sit well with me regarding how jQuery is supposed to endure a little past the few browser versions it supports right this instant. And I _know_ we cannot safeguard against all future bugs", but I sure hope we can properly handle the ones we fix today so that the code is adapted to variations on the same theme.

jquery,1007,closed,27,2012-10-24 16:21:12,52.53,,1,,"b'b"" No", I strongly disagree with that, Dave. Global ajax options are not bad practice, they are just awfully badly implemented in jQuery because they mix actual global configuration options and plain _default_ options. It\'s the latter that causes us problems all the time, including in this very PR, not the former, far from it. I\'m perfectly fine with  , and (the latter being undocumented btw) being exposed globally as a means to configure  , just like I\'m fine with because they all fall in the global configuration category. Is the fact they\'re specifically designed to break code expectations throughout an entire application an issue? Of course, not. That\'s why they exist in the first place. I\'m also fine with being able to override those global configurations on a per-request basis. Most useful example is probably a converter being overriden because a specific webservice cannot output properly formatted data. No, the real problem lies with default options that are not at all related to configuration. This covers pretty much any option that wasn\'t mentionned here already. and come to mind. While it seems convenient to have default for those, they turn out to be more trouble than they are worth because they break code expectations mindlessly. They do not apply to a range of requests, they don\'t cover several  scenarios, they\'re just obfuscating code and making things unpredictable for no sensible reason. I am in favour of an configuration, undocumented like  . We screwed up with the name of several options. We won\'t fix all of them but we could use an aliasing facility as a means to deprecate then remove at least here while leaving a backward compatibility hook. If we screw up with naming stuff, so do our users, something to ponder when we gave them prefilters as a means to create and support their own options. does the job but it\'s as ad hoc, clunky and unreadable as it can get. Now, it\'s not @farmdawgnation\'s fault. I would have written it exactly like this but I think we know better than pushing the first idea we have in the repo because it gets the work done. We do, right? I know in which state I found and its always adcode. Never again, please. So, no, we won\'t agree on the global options being bad practice part of your argumentation, because it\'s just not quite where the problem lies. Also," I compare sizes because a special cased code being in the same order of magnitude in code size as a generic approach is not random. How I wish it was always the case.

There are already tests before this that assert that stuff like that is working fine. Once past that we can just use this. We also use hasClass, addClass, remove, load and what not in unit tests. Also," the other reason I did this is to fix the ""Content MIME type"" warnings I was getting in Chrome. Those are all gone now. As for the content type changing based on which headers are passed", that\\\'s not true in the latest version. The logic is like this:  responds with whatever content-type it is told to respond with. If none given, the default behaviour is that plain echo is sent with  . Any extended information (the query parameter is set) is sent as JSON (with the proper content type). No implications," but explicit like that. Note that the parameter is not  . I don\\\'t see how it makes a difference whether it is in the same script or not. Instead of the content-type changing between """" and ""echo"" it now changes between ""echo?content"" and ""echo?extended"". I even thought about merging the other two in as well.

The json and jsonp logic are actually far far ""behind"" which makes all the difference in the world. Unit tests are units", they should not test more than what they are supposed to test (and, yes, we have some further cleanup to do). They also should be independant on whether a previous test passed or not (keep aside most extreme cases like Deferreds being broken). If you have implicit json responses," then you test a whole bunch of the internals of each time you wanna test something completely unrelated (headers). You created a hidden dependency in the javascript unit test because of some logic in PHP. That\\\'s why I started the rewrite: things had gone very wrong because too big a proportion of the logic of our ajax tests was taking place in PHP due to ""magical"" scripts that would do one thing or another", implicit changes to the response given an unrelated parameter. They created hidden dependencies _client-side_, they were also hidding actual problems in our unit tests. The fact we had a lot of PHP scripts that served no purpose is one thing and good riddance. But the goal here is to empower our javascript unit tests and give them power over the whole client-server cycle. Implicit logic server-side like changing the content type because headers are supposed to be set is a no-go. I\\\'m guessing the actual reason you\\\'re doing so is because it makes it simpler to test for the results using deepEqual: if so create a helper client-side that does the parsing / test but keep the content type alone, please :)\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, I realize that sentence alone will likely elicit a strong reaction, especially within the jQuery team. However, Sugar makes an argument that there is a safe way to augment JS natives by being safe, conservative in approach, tons of testing, and a few fundamental differences to Prototype (most of this is detailed here url  Sugar takes a certain stance, but I do see valid points to both sides of the argument. However, I believe that the pull request I have submitted," lies _outside_ this argument. The crux of the issue is that jQuery is checking for the property on an object that is assumed to be a but in fact may also be a string. When making this assumption it should do a type check to ensure that the object is an instance of before assuming the property on it. I am anticipating a counterpoint that ""it is reasonable for libs to assume ""clean"" prototypes"" and I think there is a valid point to be made there. However I have my own counterpoints to that", and regardless this change can only serve to make jQuery more robust. Also I believe that if you are presuming a property it is reasonable to assume it to be scoped to the object you have defined it on. I am probably going to remove this method from Sugar anyway, 1. as an emergency fix on the assumption that this pr will take a while to be released even if it is accepted and 2. because it never fit into the lib very well anyway.

jquery,1140,closed,12,2013-01-22 05:29:01,641.33,1,,,b'b\' @gnarf37 Thanks for replying...Agreed of course, but doesn\\\'t it make sense to fix these edge cases as they come up? I\\\'m not requesting here that we sweep the code... edge cases should be dealt with ad-hoc in my opinion, but they should be dealt with. I\\\'m also asking a real question as well... Maybe there actually is a legitimate reason not to fix this issue?But that\\\'s exactly the issue here. It\\\'s also something that I think every library author should expect, regardless of their stance on prototypes. jQuery is probably the most included script in the world. It will inevitably run up against modified prototypes, and it will, in this instance, break. Now of course you can say to people that it\\\'s simply wrong to modify prototypes, and as I said before I think that\\\'s a valid opinion. But we both know that doesn\\\'t matter to the poor soul who simply wanted to use both libs together and has no idea why that doesn\\\'t work. At the end of the day it\\\'s a breakage that jQuery could have prevented, and without modifying it\\\'s stance on prototypes either. I\\\'m not asking jQuery to _condone_ prototype modification, I\\\'m simply asking it to _expect_ it. I believe that is valid advice even if  never existed in the first place. Another example to reinforce this point... Many devs out there have taken a stance against libraries modifying prototypes, but with the understanding that if the code is all under your own control, then it is acceptable. However _even that_ would break here, as the code in question is making assumptions about the state of the prototype object, which _can_ be modified (regardless of whether or not it should be).You\\\'re right... completely agree, but that\\\'s really quite irrelevant to this point in the end. could have been anything.Honestly I\\\'m not concerned about taking direct action on _this_ ticket so much as I am in changing the attitude. really didn\\\'t fit into Sugar, and I had actually been planning on removing it so this problem was a no-brainer. However that will most definitely _not_ be the case if this happens again.I repeat this every time it comes up, but Sugar DOES NOT, HAS NOT, and WILL NOT EVER modify . There is a very major difference between decorating and other native objects.I realize you weren\\\'t responding to me here but to repeat the major points:  1) As a stance, Sugar agrees to avoiding  ," but not the other prototypes. 2) We need to make a sepration here between ""avoiding prototype modification as a stance"""," and ""expecting prototype modification (assuming the ""worst"") for the sake of robust code"". They are fundamentally different"," and saying ""we can count on these assumptions because we are vocal about them"" represents a disconnect here. I always wear a seatbelt when I drive", but that doesn\\\'t mean when I drive my friends I should always assume that they will too.I would argue that type checking is _always_ necessary as you should never be making assumptions about prototypes. Doing so is akin to, if not identical to, the kind of assumptions you make by overwriting them in the first place. However," I\\\'m willing to consider what you\\\'re saying as valid if you can suggest a means by which we can arrive on the definition of what a ""dangerous method name"" is...Remember", this isn\\\'t simply about someone adding a method and breaking everything. For this issue to arise means that the jQuery code is itself making assuptions. If the code was doing a check for on something that could even potentially be a string, I would be making exactly the same arguments and just as strenuously. A library should not be making assumptions about prototypes one way or another. The exception is of course for  , which is why Sugar avoids them.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jquery,1140,closed,13,2013-01-22 05:29:01,76.55,,1,,b'b\' @ermouth Perhaps you missed the last lines of my message.  I\\\'m not opposed to adding some extra type-check sanity to support a lib used by a small subset of our users.  I don\\\'t think any of us really are.  To be honest," I\\\'m a bit offended that you think I am making these points from a point of \\\'power\\\' or \\\'arrogance\\\' worth calling me a ""highness"".  I was adding my opinion", in an attempt to add a few extra words on the topic that @dmethvin didn\\\'t type out before he hit close. Let me re-iterate my points since you seem more interested in giving us shit than being reasonable:I _personally_ support adding more type checking when needed to avoid these problems.The team feels that most prototype decoration is dangerous and unnecessary, we don\\\'t treat anyone special here. We happen to not run into problems from your love-buddy crockford\\\'s method he adds to prototypes because the method name is generally benign and not something we accidentally clash with. Also, it is a method that exists in the ECMA spec ever since JSON was added, so we are well aware of its potential to be there.This particular case is special.  @andrewplummer removed this method from sugar, which allows us to kind of ignore the fact that the problem existed in the first place. New versions of sugar won\\\'t create  this problem at all.  If this were something that was going to persist, we may take a different action.We try to write the least amount of code necessary to complete the task at hand, and getting very explicit about type checking things causes more code, this is why we are generally against doing it.We don\\\'t think we are any better than you. @andrewplummer I am aware of the fact that it is jQuery making an assumption that got us into trouble in the first place," but at some level we must make some assumptions about the type of data we get.  If we have a ""namespace"" property on the argument", we assume it\\\'s a string, because that\\\'s how we use it internally.  This assumption got us into trouble here.  It created a problem with your library, and for this I personally apologize even though I never touched this code.  Thanks for bringing it to our attentions, and thanks for removing it so we don\\\'t have to worry about it. The particular point I made about is actually a very important one.  jQuery\\\'s code base uses the presence of a property as a way to detect elements.  If someone were to add jQuery would start assuming every string passed to it was an element instead.  There are a lot of checks in the codebase, and if someone did do this, it would create havoc. The moral of this story, prototype decoration can cause problems with other libraries hidden deep inside some method due to JavaScript\\\'s duck typed nature.  This is why we highly suggest against it.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jquery,1140,closed,14,2013-01-22 05:29:01,77.22,,,1,b'b\' @gnarf37  This issue is actually more complex than it appears, so I want to be explicit. I don\\\'t think that the fact that the code assumes the property to be a string is the issue. Instead I believe the problem is that it assumes _any_ property with special meaning on an object that has the potential to be of built-in type. In this case the variable could be one of three things: a string, a vanilla object," or a object. So the question is ""is it safe to assume the internal property on any or all of these?"" 1) If you know that it is a object", then of course I think it\\\'s perfectly fine to assume that is a string, or anything you want as it\\\'s an internal object. 2) If you know that it is vanilla object, then this is the middle-ground. Of course it may or may not be safe to assume that is untouched (even Sugar would not affect this), but it may be more complex than that. Let\\\'s say that the object passed did not have a property on it but inherited from an object that does. This would be an example of how this code could break even if remained untouched. I would argue that to be properly robust here a check is in order. If the property is directly defined, however, then I would say that from the signature of the method itself it\\\'s fair to assume it to be a string... I don\\\'t see any problem with that. 3) If you know that it is a string, then it doesn\\\'t make sense to assume any properties on it at all. It should not even be able to get this far. However note that here the check describe above would also serve as a fix here (in fact it\\\'s probably even better than the fix I proposed here). If you used this method it would be possible to alleviate the issue without even requiring a type check in the first place," which would also satisfy @otakustay\\\'s idea about duck-typing.I really don\\\'t agree with this on a fundamental level. In the first place I think that a method should properly check its input whenever possible and concerns about ""more code"" should be secondary. Of course it\\\'s fair to contain this within bounds of reason", but in any case I don\\\'t see this being an issue that _necessarily_ generates huge amounts of code. For this example," this method is essentially saying ""I will accept anything that has a property defined on it"". What it should be saying (imo) is one of two things: 1) I will accept any _object_ ( ) that has a property defined on it.2) I will accept anything that has a property defined _directly_ on it ( ) In retrospect", I actually believe the 2nd way is the best way, and I can most definitely update this PR to reflect that. But let\\\'s just continue with this for a second. This kind of pattern should be common around the jQuery library so a method could be created to do exactly that. Whereas right now you have: this could easily become: Function name is hilariously long, but after minification it would add as little as _six bytes_ (plus the actual method code itself), and this code could be reused everywhere. Again I\\\'m not suggesting you sweep the codebase but _if_ you were to be doing this check every time you accept user input, I argue that it would make jQuery much more robust as a whole.The example is an interesting one. I\\\'ve actually tried my hand at  detection before, so I know how hard it can be. However let\\\'s say that you had a method that accepts arbitrary input... If you were to depend on the property to detect elements then the most proper check would probably be as is never a direct property. In that sense of course could not be used as in the example above. Now of course I realize that this check is probably being used everywhere so performance issues may exist. However in this case a simple is in order, no? (  is fast) I\\\'m simply listing up a way that even if were modified jQuery could continue to function properly. All in all it sounds to me that you\\\'re more open than I first thought (well.. at least you @gnarf37 ) and are treating this particular instance as a special case, so that\\\'s encouraging.

Do we really want to make the code more difficult to ?How aggressively is the minified version size augmented by this ? Everyone is not using gzip. I\'d love to have stats that actually establishes the majority does. Also, the augmentation of the minified size would be nice to have. Like @gibson042, I toyed with the order of var decls in files to see huge change in  size. However I always thought the process of re-ordering the var decls without assignments should be automatized. Let a tool handle this and we won\'t have to think about it or wonder if we found the best permutations. Problem is there are 39916800 permutations as @orkel pointed out, so it would mean uglyfying 39916800 to find the best. One could argue euristics could be found," but even ordering by number of occurences of the variables in the code is not good: it\'s all about repeating patterns throughout the file so it\'s about naming variables so that the same code appears throughout various . So I seriously doubt the approach is feasible anyway. Maybe we can lax some uglify js rules so that it gzips better but re-ordering variables like this is non-sense.

The use case is when I want to add some variable string into a selector, without breaking the selector. For example," this is broken for parameters like ""a.b"": function getElementById2(id) {  return $(""#"" + id);} I should write this instead: function getElementById2(id) {  return $(""#"" + $.selectorescape(id));} There could be many such vulnerabilities out there like that already. For example", this was just fixed in  MVC here: &nbsp;url  . They added their own escape mechanism for 4 metacharacters .:[], I don\\\'t know if its enough or not," and who knows what some other people might think what should be escaped.  It makes sense to me that the question ""hey", mr. interpreter," which characters should I escape for you?"" can be best answered by the interpreter itself. A good example of that is the regex escaping in .NET: &nbsp;url  . It knows what the special characters are and how they should be escaped", so you can put user-supplied strings into a regexp without worrying about anything. \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Every time when an engine supports certain magic characters, the user may accidentally submit a string which does something else than intended. Also the engine has no way to know what\\\'s intentional and what\\\'s not. The best solution is if the engine itself provides a proper escaping function. The engine knows what to escape, the user only has to know to call it for string parts where no special interpretation is intended. These functions are way too simple to put into plugins," and they should be the integral parts of the interpreting engines because the rules may change over time.

jquery,2207,closed,2,2015-04-13 23:15:28,199.08,,1,,"b'b"" Is this in response to #2094? The logic in this patch is wrong. it is dropping out of the dispatch loop if someone deletes one handler", even if there are more handlers on the list. The unit tests you added aren\'t complete enough to catch that. From a performance standpoint, this is putting a lot of overhead on the dispatch code. If there are N handlers for an element we now traverse the handler list up to N-squared times inside the dispatcher via  . Although we might be able to use that in master,we\'d need to use in compat, which would be even slower. In #2094 we resolved to just document this because it was such a rare edge case. If there was a simple way to push the overhead to where we\'d rarely see it, we could fix it but I think that would involve exposing the dispatcher\'s handler list (or a deletion method). It doesn\'t seem worth the complexity to me but maybe there\'s a simpler solution I haven\'t seen.

It is happening on inline elements wrapping block elements", which is valid in HTML5, such as a header and an image wrapped in a single anchor. Two issues arise:1. Different browsers report  of the anchor differently. For example Firefox would report one visible anchor in the example below, and Chrome will report 0. This also highly depends on the CSS styles applied, as on the page where this issue was discovered missing images are not displayed at all instead of the common missing image icon.2. While a browser may report an anchor as invisible, child elements are still visible and clickable as they inherit anchor properties.## Example  # Solution There are 2 potential solutions that come to mind, but each has flaws1. Loop through child elements and check each for visibility. Potentially harmful for performance, although the selector is already marked as such in the documentation. 2. Check parent for visibility. Probably not enough on its own, as it will report incorrectly," if anchor doesn\'t have visible children.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But more importantly, the cost of working around this would be far greater than we are willing to deal with.

I think we can agree that this is exactly how folks use jQuery\\\'s and today. To quote the guidelines in the spec:I interpret this as meaning that, if you intend for a screenreader to still be able to access the content, you shouldn\\\'t use  . But the same holds true for -when you use it, the element you use it on is totally hidden from everything (including screen readers).This makes a lot of assumptions about how a tabpanel is being used, and I think it\\\'s what tripped you up. When read one way, it implies that you shouldn\\\'t use (or even !) on a tabpanel, which is not true. Every tabpanel implementation I\\\'ve seen uses or on hidden on all panels not associated with the selected tab (and sometimes also to really hammer it in that it\\\'s hidden from screen readers too). Read another way (and I think this was the intended meaning), it means that," if your intention is to perform ""overflow management"" -that is", presenting the user with a subset of a large set of content -then is the wrong tool to use as it hides the rest of the content completely," when it should really only be ""out of sight"," yet not actively hidden from assistive technology and keyboard navigation. Without debating the intention of a tabpanel, I think we can agree that, when a user calls  , they intend for the content to be hidden visually and from screenreaders. That\\\'s exactly how it works now when sets  , and I believe that toggling of the attribute in jQuery\\\'s and would be in line with the spec.\''

If so then why not just use something like in PR #2374 and simply allowing adding edge-cases for advanced developers. I would see this by documenting how to add new {elementName:defaultDisplay} mapping (to support defining new elements if someone must). I also like the approach in jQueryMobile where they have a standard event that just works and for those that need more performance. Forcing someone to use something more complicated for something simple might end up just loosing him on the way.

However i was wrong and i think this has more potential to break things in userland then the change for how is handled.  This comes up in ui and mobile quite a bit it turns out. Both jQuery UI and Mobile allow widgets to be instantiated on a default element in a detached state via and also just in general allow instantiating widgets on detached elements for improved performance among other reasons.  There are also many many situations where a widget or other plugin of some sort may be instantiated or called inside of a hidden container. This is a major issue for plugin authors that cant ever reasonably know if they may be inside a hidden container ( think popups panels etc ) or in jQuery Mobile everything is hidden when the page is initialized.  This all means where as in the past you could call on any element with out any worry you now need to always check the return value before using it. So it will make a lot of code go from  to   Who knows it would not surprise me if you start seeing things where is used a lot", doing something like the below to just not have to worry about it.  Because with this change it essentially makes it ( as a plugin author ) never safe to use with out first checking its return value, unless it is in direct response to a user action," that essentially cant happen on hidden or detached elements. for example dragging and mouse interaction type stuff ( this is a case for many of the cases of in ui ) '""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The original change was made to master last year and it was shipped in early January. The reason it has resurrected this week is because Wordpress did an update, some Wordpress themes were impacted, and there appears to be no auto-update for themes. Had any of this come to light last year or even right after the 1.12.0 release we could have done something different, but let\'s not revisit this change now. Better to have people update their themes. The going-forward question is how Wordpress will ever update to jQuery 3.0. Right now WP includes both 1.12.x and Migrate 1.x in order to let themes be sloppy.  If they were to upgrade to jQuery 3.0 the themes would need to be able to run with jQuery 1.12 _without_ Migrate before a jQuery3+Migrate3 combination would allow them to work. Given all the uproar about changing an invalid undocumented thing like unquoted attributes I worry how something more substantial will fare.

That is assumed by the consumers as an implicit behavior inherent from jQuery philosophy. Therefore not many people bothered in surrounding anything in a  clause. A minor update is not expected to break everything. For that reason, any fix that changes the behavior from noop to throw an Error will have a higher impact than a fix that breaks a behavior but doesn\'t stops all scripts in the page. My suggestion in the future to prevent this kind of problem is to treat any behavior change from noop to Error as a major breaking change worth changelog," even if it is not undocumented.

The thing we did not know at the time was that it seems several popular Wordpress themes used the feature.

If they do, this will be one of the smaller problems.It\'s trickier than that as I understand. Wordpress by default always puts in a relatively recent jQuery+Migrate, and updates these as part of its own auto-update cycle. Some themes and plugins outside the theme use this one, since it\'s there. Others are more paranoid and load their own via noConflict, which of course gets wasteful since the page is loading multiple copies.

You are pretty close to spot on the last part about themes loading extra jQuery. @FagnerMartinsBrack Well said. @timmywil You are partially correct", they can do that. But there are 2 ways to do it, WP uses an asset queing system (see wp_enqueue_script). It allows for dynamic inclusion of scripts from themes and plugins including dependency management. IE my plugin uses jQuery so I can tell WP to load it before mine. So if a theme needs an older version they are either replacing it for every script that needed jquery. The alternative would be them enqueing a custom version of jquery separately and using noConflct. @gibson042 That may be a bit presumptuous. WP Core philosophies are a bit different than yours of course, but when 25%+ of the internet runs your software in an extendable way like it is, your hands are bound as well. Their are breaking changes quite regularly, but they are well documented, get distributed directly to developers via many channels well before release etc. @markelog, @dmethvin I wouldn\'t start backtracking, that wasn\'t the point of my initial comment. But had this been well documented the WP Core team would have made sure to both distribute the changes and info to all, but their automated  scanners in the  repository would have also been able to flag themes using it. Before each release of WP an email goes to every dev telling them to check their plugins against a list of issues, themes are automatically scanned (hopefully plugins soon too). I am glad to see the conversation moving," but I would suggest that since WP uses jQuery as a core dependency and a large percentage rely on that it may behoove you and the WP Core team to work out a direct communication channel to discuss these things in detail.

The reason seems to be that 3dccf62c removed the around the following check in  : When is called for an object which has a property with a non-falsy, non-function value," it now throws a (""Cannot convert undefined or null to object"").

But as far as I can see", this is not prohibited by an Ecmascript spec (up to and including ES2015). I also understand that it is discussable whether such objects should be reported as _plain_ or not. But running into a seems quite unexpected. Adding the back might not be the best way to fix this. But maybe the check could be made more robust by some other mean, e.g. adding another condition (motivated by the concrete error)  or by checking whether is of type function (motivated by the original intention: check whether the standard  backlink points to  ) Please let me know your thoughts about this: regression or valid simplification?

After all, the purpose of this ticket is to prevent the un-typed promise object (the object) from running around in 3.0, this kind of ugliness should be rectified if jQuery were to be the goto DOM bridger that powers IoT and mobile device UIs (those with screens of course). Promise objects have a general type in each modern browser, maybe named differently but if by definition is of the Promise type it should pass the SomeClass type check so callback chains can be formed with both sync and async routines without checking for each of the async returns like some kind of workaround of another workaround...  The $.Deferred was never a properly defined pseudo class in the first place, using it to hack out a promise object is kind of brilliant and stupid at the same time. While a few lines of code in this ticket could potentially extend its life-time in a backward compatible way, I would rather see it gets rewritten.

(on cleaner syntax level compare to me explicitly checking .alway() or .then() or wrapping with on every returned object first regardlessly in that case...) Again", the purpose of this ticket is to have a way of detecting the promised object (if you want to call it objects like A+ that\'s fine), not to have it merged my way (my hack was just an example). The problem is always with Javascript since we can fake pseudo class to put a type on objects but never really can detect -in boosted objects native-ly (not if we kept using directly on plain objects to do this). You guys obviously agree to the fact that A+ is an interface, so I\'ll ask again like this,1.  What would you do if want to detect that an object has certain  without a complete check of available  apis on that object? (in JS realm of course)2. Can we give jqXHR a way of being detected native-ly (through instanceof)? (you gave me which is an api that re-ensures  ... so my object returned from any of the callback in the vector can\'t have if it is not a promise and don\'t want to be called immediately) For the sake of this argument, please don\'t ask why I wanted to put a in an object which is not a promise, it is not the point... For now it might not be a big deal for promise since it has only 1 api to check and skip, and I can see the kind of hacking mindset is towards privacy of methods instead of declarative typing.  You are essentially saying that  with plain object in jQuery is the way to go forward and for each protected  you will have a alike to glue it back in a way that that -ed object is supposed to be used. @jaubourg Does the _standard_ you are looking at demands a hidden A+ object? In every other language that does support , you have a native way of detecting the object type. It is not like _it is not required to be of type Promise_, it is because when you declare Promise as an implemented interface, the objects become of type Promise and their own original type at the same time automatically in that language.  With Javascript we can\'t. If using it requires that you have a in its prototype chain. And you have no way of protecting _private_ apis once it is there. If using a check like we have privacy and protection but need one check for each interface... I\'d rather we go the first way since we all know that Javascript doesn\'t have privacy designed in mind at all, you can see that with the free and cheap re-binding routines. Why are we keep saying safe and read-only?  Neither nor returns any typed object at the moment and this is 3.0 we are talking about. Asking people to use with Deferred and is really messed up especially with written as it is (a var name!!) in the online documentation for $.ajax() return. Why would I want to know the name of a return? I need the TYPE!! I know everything is an Object, but didn\'t I bring up that I need to use in the first place so that I can divert the processing routines accordingly? Anyway, I\'m using it for free, so doesn\'t really want to complain, just leaving a note here for other people. In case you don\'t understand where I stand, here are the facts: a. Like using to get jQuery objects, you use to get a deferred object, however, the following appears in your console: The deferred object has a super set of A+ promise apis. b. There is no $.Promise, neither is the native Promise in your browser used, call .promise() from a deferred object to get a promise object. or just use or to return a wrap. Either way the returned objects are of type Object. You will see the word Promise as the return object written in the documentation, that\'s just for your viewing pleasure. Also you can read this  url  in the light that it will confuse you even more as what the  , and is trying to do when everything could have just use Promise itself in v3.0, also I have tried to convince the developers to just use as a proper class like the native Promise but no, they refused, they love having 3 different things around to feel safe and look sophisticated. (Please don\'t bring up IE11 as we are talking about modern browsers and v3) c. returned by related calls is a plain object, it has A+ interfaces mixed in by  , but it is not of type jQuery,  , nor Promise, is it just an object. use with it if you want to but most of us will just use jqXHR directly without. So don\'t panic if jqXHR feels like a promise object but is really some hacked object of no type with .then() interfaces, the developers think this is the jQuery way of comply to the A+ standard. End of note regarding  ," and in an attempt to let jqXHR be of type $.Deferred. (Which should really be just Promise in native JS engines) Please don\'t think I am in love with nor jQuery itself when I submitted the ticket. I did it because I came across v3 branch and still see the ugly code in there so I thought I try. Sorry to have disturbed the peaceful minds. I assume that there is no plan of using Promise directly nor fixing $.Deferred in v3 now.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I love JS objects just as much as you guys do, but sometimes there should be limit. That\'s all I\'m saying. It\'s v3, I really hope we can get out of this **plain type** factory pattern and have some clearly defined interfacing contract types. @dmethvin Brought up ES6 in the discussion, and I think it is worth mentioning because JS class in ES6 has only functions. So this means jQuery would need to give up the **plain type** factories and define proper contract classes, it before it with states and finally return the objects at some later time anyway.  I don\'t like Java to be honest, so I\'m not trying to have full blown class definitions here (or anywhere else). Plain objects () with contracts (interfaces) would be more than enough, especially in the JS realm we can mix and match them freely, just **be clear** (have it on paper with a contract) about what\'s given and what\'s returned. If $.Deferred is not up for the task, then by all means use a new class or the native Promise.  Again, I\'m not against using factories," just the way we obtain for returning contract-able objects.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The changes made in jQuery 3.0 are intended to improve ES6 Promise interoperability as much as we can without breaking five year\'s worth of existing jQuery user code.

If you\'re asking about our guarantees", we take pains to ensure that promises allow registering callbacks on Deferred objects but _not_ resolving them. We also guarantee that non-progress callbacks are invoked no more than once, and that Deferred state changes no more than once. And as of jQuery 3.0, we further guarantee that both Deferreds and their promises adhere to Promises/A+, so our is what everyone expects. I did look at implementing inheritance while honoring those guarantees, but decided that the benefit wasn\'t worth the increased file size... especially when considering the inability of to recognize objects from _other_ jQuery instances. The simple fact is that we (i.e., Javascript developers) already _have_ a means of recognizing promises, even if it has warts: the method. And and even provide a means of getting a thenable from any value. But like it or not," this ship has already sailed.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is good to know how we arrived at the point with some extra details. v3 is a major version release", there might not be a better time to introduce advancement in the price of incompatibilities (or remove some protective precautions in our case, which looks a bit wild I know). But again, I\'m not pushing my way of changing nor are the one deciding. I can see and appreciate the extra mile involved in the current decision.  ES6 has a long way to make it to the browser, and there will be a time when chaotic co-existing backward compatible runtimes are offered by different vendors. Whether or not to have detectable _interfaced_ objects early is entirely up to the lib developers and I do hope the group that\'s leading that era is still jQuery. I picked $.Deferred as a start because promise is a well known contract. For the record, after all these years giving me a JS object that I can\'t do whatever I want (freely extend) is unacceptable. But there were times when I did desperately need a lock on the object type to get the guaranteed interfaces. And those moments always challenged my feelings about Javascript. If you already asked the question: _What would I do with without to the rescue?_, you certainly will have its evil twin popped the other way around like: _What if the is the problem?_  And to our discussion, the specifics are in the minds not the implementation. After all, giving the lib users a $.Deferred that can be resolved only once is re-assuring enough. Anyone who wants to go nuts about resolving an ajax call  would probably want to and will not be interfered by the real ajax return resolved by XMLHttpRequest (it might be a reject but based on your description the state changes only once, so no worries there neither).

Mention the issue number here.Currently", jQuery silently swallows exceptions thrown in the body of a function passed as argumentin the event handler. For instance: will not result in any exception raise in the browser. This PR attempts to fix it by giving the abilityof adding another function in the handler, so that if an exception occurs in such situation described above, the exception function will be fired. This function takes as argument the Error object given internally propagated to it, so that it can be used inside the function. If no such function is provided, code now outputs the exception error message in the console.This fix works in all  , and calls. Note: This fix is applied on the implementation, not the one.

Logically, the expression is a no-op. The comment indicates that somebody once saw it cause some side effect in an unspecified version of Safari. For this reason, no lint will pass such a line. This comment confirms that our lint was forced to ignore the transgression.   If a fuse blows, you don\\\'t put tinfoil between the contacts; it\\\'s trying to tell you that something is wrong.  Furthermore, what makes us think that the parent of an will be a  ? Could be an [ ]url As this issue has the potential to foul up form input, it should be given a high priority.  I\\\'ll leave the solution to this one as an exercise for the moment. A solution was given to Resig several years ago and discussed in the old jQuery forum," as well as on Usenet. He mentioned something about not wanting to add an extra line and confirmed that he couldn\\\'t find a browser that ""proved"" it didn\\\'t work (i.e. show me where it fails). Hint: the no-op line has the answer and discards it. ;)  ### Link to test case ###  No test case. Not known for sure where or when it might fail. Do know that elements without at least one containing a attribute are vulnerable (as that creates an *implicitly* selected  ).  Likely not an issue once the page is loaded", but without reviewing the DOM standards, can\\\'t say for sure when browsers are required to set the property to reflect an implicit selection. Instead of worrying about that (or testing), let\\\'s just fix the logic.  PS. There is an attempt at a feature test that sets a flag that isn\\\'t checked in relation to the above line, but it is checked in other areas of the code with similar lines:   One problem with that test is that it is testing a *disembodied* and there\\\'s certainly no guarantee that it will pass based on any standard that I know of (again," would have to consult the specifications). So false positives for this ""problem"" will likely occur", adding additional no-op execution for no reason at all. I know that jQuery is supposed to work with document fragments, but the tested is without even that.  Another problem is it doesn\\\'t test the assumed solution to see if it improves the situation, only that there may be a problem. Again, this will result in no-op execution without any reason to expect it will do anything useful.  A third problem is that the name of the flag ( ) is not very descriptive of what it is supposed to mean. If it wasn\\\'t tacked on to this object, we could make the name as long as we want as the minification process would reduce it. Regardless, saving a few bytes at the expense of clarity is a bad trade (not to mention that HTTP compression will likely end up saving the bytes anyway).  If we just fix the logic for the half dozen related lines then we don\\\'t need this test at all. And BTW," what does ""Support: IE <= 11 only"" imply? See similar comments throughout and they don\\\'t make a lot of sense to me (e.g. the original hack in this case was for some unspecified Safari version).\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You had to spend time later trying to see if the offending lines could be removed because the problem wasn\\\'t fixed properly at the time it was identified. IIRC, it was yet another case of not wanting to add a line or two due to file size concerns; however, the related feature test would have been removed as a result, so the net would have been a push at worst.  As mentioned, I posted a solution several years ago on Usenet, which was then relayed to Resig, who decided not to use it (and famously went on to attack my character repeatedly, but that\\\'s another sad story in the history of this project). Though, as a result," he did add an extra line to try to support in a different area of the code:   Look carefully and there\\\'s a bug in there in that the getter and setter are not in agreement in how they implement the no-op hack.  So we\\\'ve established that they are *old* mystical incantations. As for ""needing"" them", that\\\'s incorrect. No need. I\\\'ve provided enough information in the post to fix the code (and without going back and searching for the original proposed answer). Will provide the fix again if nobody comes up with it here. Hint: the solution is not to simply delete the no-op lines (though they certainly vanish along with the indirect feature test).  Pulling back a bit from the posted snippet to see its context provides another clue:   Again," we have a terse and ambiguous comment (and a bit oddly stated as well). What *exactly* does it mean by ""makes selected-by-default options in Safari work properly""? That\\\'s a rhetorical question as hopefully we all know exactly what this hack is trying to accomplish as it was discussed in the forum several years ago. Once the answer is posted", it will be clear that no such assurances are needed. This is a basic logic problem; as is usually the case in browser scripting, it\\\'s not about gathering empirical evidence as such evidence proves nothing (and certainly not when we are talking about an unevenly applied mystical incantation).  Testing comes after the logic is clearly fixed and I have to figure there are existing unit tests for this. If not, they should be added. But I\\\'d bet my house they won\\\'t be needed. ;)  And I thoroughly disagree that this is a non-essential change as I\\\'ve identified an inconsistency in the use of the feature test result (as well as the indirect nature of the test itself). In other words, the *existing* hack isn\\\'t even applied consistently, which indicates that the unit tests are either incomplete or have never been run in an environment featuring the quirk we are trying to spackle over.  Additionally, it would be difficult to determine if anyone has ever been bitten by the bug or if they actually took the time to complain here (or on StackOverflow, Usenet, etc.) If they did," it would have likely taken the form of [""it doesn\\\'t work""]url  and perhaps a ""try this"" suggestion helped them get around it.

Some browsers have been known to delay setting the property of the *implicitly* selected  . It\'s a very old problem and typically isn\'t an issue unless trying to reference this property before the document is ready.  Q. So what should we do about it?  A. First of all, lose the indirect feature test as it is using a disembodied  . Second, get rid of the hack as once we set the property, it is clearly no longer an issue. And third, get rid of the hack as well as it simply discards the answer.  Finally, in the (  ) method, change the way you check whether an is selected. As hinted above, the hack references and then throws away the property. That property *is* the answer to the problem of determining whether an is selected or not.

And as mentioned repeatedly (and as you can see below)", the answers were right where I pointed; instead of telling me to go back, would have been better to follow my lead and review the original issue and proposed solution. I already knew what they were as I *posted* them.  Or perhaps you mean I should have avoided posting the answer here after everyone else else refused to go back and look at the history I mentioned? Doesn\\\'t really matter now as the ticket is *closed*.  For those who want to learn something from all this, here\\\'s the history:  url That thread from 2009 starts off about and then turns to the issue in this post from Matt Kruse.  url  Note that Matt states quite clearly at the start of this thread that he\\\'s relaying suggestions from me. That\\\'s why I kept telling you that you were wasting time telling me to go back and read the history. In other words," of course I know what I\\\'m doing. I wrote this book. :)discussed. Can anyone point me to it? I am curious. Resig answers a few posts later: Later Matt and Resig discussed a half-baked ""fix"" for the issue:  url ...which is the very hack that we are discussing here *now*", seven years later. So, as mentioned repeatedly, there are no new test cases needed. Even @dmethvin mentioned that he had tried to *remove* (not replace) the hack and got unit test errors. Did I mention that no new test cases are needed? :)  There are tickets referenced as well: But note that Resig only took about half of my suggestions, rejecting the one I mentioned at the very start in *this* ticket, which is to replace the hack with logic that makes sense. The code is right there in the first post and it is almost exactly what I suggested above. Comes after the paragraph where Matt starts out:identified.  That would be me and whoever else was in the related CLJ discussion. Yes, that CLJ. The group Resig not only refused to read, but refused to hear about at times, insisting nobody could mention any suggested solutions that originated from that Usenet group. That\\\'s one reason that obvious junk code remains in the jQuery to this day.  In addition to Resig, who else is present in that first thread? None other than @dmethvin. Yes, that @dmethvin. The guy who single-handedly stalled this ticket until it was closed, insisting that I go back and find the history, so that I would not be confused about what that code was doing in there. :)  url As that was back in 2009 and it would be roughly another three years until the main subject of that thread ( ) was (ahem) fixed. Well, attempted and then reverted and then... we\\\'ll never know as I\\\'m not even getting into any more of this junk in 2017.

The (incorrectly referenced as in jQuery) method is a hideously complex black box that virtually never needs to be opened. In twenty years of browser scripting, I\\\'ve managed to avoid it almost entirely (exception that comes to mind was an HTML editor).  Regardless," jQuery aspires to fix the whole thing and frequently gets into trouble. Consider this ""hook"" for the and styles:   The cryptically named flag refers to a test result where a percentage-based style fails to compute to pixel units. This is an issue that dates back to the bad old days of IE 8-", where was frequently used by libraries as a slightly-off substitute for  ; it didn\\\'t convert *any* units to pixels. jQuery certainly does this in older versions, so the problem should be familiar.  This is the part that attempts to fix the issue:   It calls the method instead, which attempts to figure the *offset* of the element from the document origin, which would only be equivalent to the computed and styles in only a small subset of cases.  For example, an element with a position style of with all parent elements having position: would work. On the other hand, an element with position would fail *unless* the document\\\'s scroll position is its origin. Furthermore, an element with position would fail in virtually every case. And so on," this ""hook"" will simply cause browsers demonstrating this quirk to return nonsensical position values in numerous cases (not even considering problems related RTL documents).  For those who never bothered to read my ""P is for Position"" primer on the old  site (now retired) or the numerous Usenet articles I authored on this subject (dating back to at least 2008)", I\\\'ll go over the general solution again.  In short:  1. Save the or style (e.g.  ). 2. Get the offset. 3. Set the or style to  . 4. Get the offset again. 5. Find the *difference* between the two offsets. 6. Put the old or style back.  And as the method is just a pointless wrapper for (seems to exist only to handle calls passing disembodied elements or elements with a display style of  ), would advise simply calling and documenting that trying to compute position styles (or offsets) for such elements will result in undefined behavior (a recurring theme here). In addition, to let callers know they made a mistake at the earliest possible time, throw an exception in such cases (as opposed to returning zeros).  HTH  PS. What about and positions? The solution as it sits is only half-finished. Luckily I archived the related primer years ago:  url PPS. As this is an old issue that surely affects previous jQuery versions, am curious as to how the old versions are kept up to date when bugs like this are fixed.  ### Link to test case ###  No test case needed.

When something is clearly wrong with the code logic (e.g. the function will not be an appropriate substitute for RTL documents), then evidence gathering is strictly a secondary concern.

And shouldn\\\'t take a comment to realize that would be the case as elements can be positioned by percentage with and styles too.  Would also have to dig up a browser that actually displays the quirks that the alleged fixes try to deal with.  As for the rest of it. Do we really need a test to determine that finding the offset from a positioned *parent* (if any) will not be equivalent to a position style (so it makes no sense to have that as the fallback?).  Much simpler to just agree that the logic in both these cases is wrong. It\\\'s *obviously* wrong and no tests could ever disprove that, no matter how many browsers and documents we try to test (a common theme in browser scripting where bugs and inconsistencies come and go over time).

As long as it stays closed, then *nobody* is going to work on it (particularly not me). Closing the ticket tells everyone who may be interested in helping to move on (nothing to see here). In this particular case," what makes you think that any ""supported"" browsers even run that BS ""hook"" code? I already know that if the test fails outside the most recent versions of a handful of browsers then it will be rejected as an irrelevant result.  So the ""hook"" that never even runs today will remain in the code because it doesn\\\'t fail any tests in ""current"" browsers. Do you follow me here? This is why you can\\\'t rely on test results for everything; have to actually understand what the code is doing to analyze test results.  The solution I propose for this is to remove whole mess. Then run the *current* unit tests in whatever narrow range of browsers we consider ""supported"" and see what happens. But again", nobody is going to do anything with a closed ticket. ;)  \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

See url  for the longstanding issue tracking that problem. As far as I can tell, the specs are pretty clear.  Firefox has a bug in that it sometimes returns rects for elements.  jQuery has a bug if it ever expects rects to be returned for elements.  The specs say that should NOT happen, and in practice it does not happen in Firefox in some cases, and should stop happening in Firefox in all cases once we fix the above-linked issue.  If it\\\'s just jQuery _consumers_ who are implicitly depending on elements having boxes, then that\\\'s their problem, sort of.

However, client vulnerabilities don\'t apply to the build server. The issue detailed in this report is not in itself a vulnerability. It allows one to echo plain text into a JavaScript file dynamically served from the build server. That is intentional.  In itself, this isn\'t an attack surface given that web browsers don\'t grant cross-origin rights to a foreign script. Loading JavaScript from domain A on a page in domain B runs the same way as if it would run from domain B (think about CDNs), it doesn\'t provide any cross-origin access to domain A. (Unlike, e.g. cross-origin HTML in an iframe).  If someone were to host on a production server that both 1) isn\'t static, and 2) uses secure cookies on the same domain, it would not pose a threat. It would first require there to be an HTML page on the same server that has actual XSS vector (e.g. something that allows arbitrary HTML injection on that page," which in turn enables the attacker to insert a script tag for  or somehow change the url of an existing script tag).""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jquery,4109,closed,11,2018-06-19 08:25:35,752.75,1,,,"b'b\' It seems like the issue the OP is reporting may be due to that Edge does not ""fully"" set focus to the input element after the page has been reloaded using the browser\\\'s ""Refresh"" button.  When the page is reloaded using the browser\\\'s ""Refresh"" button it appears that the document is not given focus", as seen by probing  , resulting in some weirdness e.g. the input caret is not in the input element even though the input element reports it has focus.  Nevertheless, I was curious and looked into this a little bit and noticed something , perhaps a bug, in jquery in this particular situation.  It is not necessarily causing the issue the OP reports, but may contribute to some confusion.  I noticed that the value of depends on other calls to  .  In the sample below, (initially) returns  . Then a call to is made and returns (*see below). From then on, the same call to now returns  .  This is due to that two different code paths are taken in jquery depending on whether contains one or more elements.  If contains one element then one code path is taken to determine the value of using the DOM method.  If contains more than one element, a different code path is taken, into Sizzle, and a different way of determining the value of is used.  Unfortunately, those two code paths return different values (for the same element) under some circumstances (in particular for when returns  ).  Furthermore, once the different code path into Sizzle has been taken for an element, then future calls will also take that path, even if contains one element only.  The result is can return one value at one time, and another value later without any changes in focus taking place just because two different methods of calculating the value exist and were used. (*: This is strange by itself from a logic point of view returns when there exists an input element that does have focus as evidenced by returning  .)  Here is the sample that demonstrates this I provide it, not as a fiddle to avoid any iframe issues coming into play, as code you have to save to a file and load in Edge.  \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Do you remember the reasons?  From what I understand the original issue wanted to set those attrs on a custom node where they don\'t have special meaning. That could be achieved by changing boolean attrs logic to account for the of an element on which it\'s applied"," although that would add quite a bit of bytes to the gzipped size.  Any change we do related to such old code will need to be treated as a breaking change and so will need to wait for 4.0.

The boolean hook is there both for back-compat-lots of code still out there with that would not work as intended-and compliance with the [standard]url  Not even the strings ""true"" and ""false"" are technically allowed.  The point is simply to write valid DOM despite common", predictable misuse of the API.  An attribute in an XML document that happens to have the same name as a boolean attribute, such as does not have any special meaning. The boolean attribute behavior only applies to HTML documents (and even then limited to certain nodeNames as @mgol pointed out).  The original bug wasn\\\'t really related to XML exactly, but it did make me think of this distinction when the user tried to access what looked like boolean attributes on a custom tag. As @mgol said, the attribute on a custom tag has no special meaning or behavior. In the old boolean hook, we used to check the corresponding property to construct a valid return value. In this case, the property of course returned  , just as it would in XML, and so it always returned for the attribute value. At some point, we started sharing a lot more attribute code with Sizzle and instead checked the attribute using  . If it returns any value at all, we assume the boolean property is and move on-this is what actually fixed the original bug.  The boolean setter hook remains in place to remove boolean attributes whenever someone tries to set  , which as @dmethvin pointed out is an artifact of the old attroperties and far too common and technically incorrect. However, Angular should have been using all along. really makes no sense, semantically. If we were completely aligned with the spec, what we should have done is set the value  , which would both be invalid and work as if the value or literally any string value were set instead, because browsers are lenient.  As for what changes to make, I\\\'m not sure. It\\\'s my understanding that boolean attributes also have no special meaning or behavior in a pure XML document (which is different than XML in HTML), even on tags that happen to be named , hence the different path for XML documents. However, XHTML presents a challenge if we cannot distinguish between XHTML (which is just XML syntax for HTML) and XML (which would display as raw XML if you tried to render it in a browser without defining the method in which to render it). We support retrieving and setting attributes in both cases.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
