Smaller feeds means faster loading and I probably only read 1 in 4 articles I read the excerpt of. So I actually find excerpted feeds to be better than full feeds.

When a website only offers a truncated feed, I am forced to go on their website to read an article. With my mobile browser and low bandwidth. It won\'t even do me any good to preload my feedreader at home, because once I find an interesting excerpt while reading my feeds on the way, I have to load the web page.

Not cool. So I\\\'ve been touching so and create those files in _posts and _pages in the same directory level than ""source"". Now", my question... What do you recommend to do? That I those dirs inside source, so Jekyll get to find them at  , and  ? Or should I copy those dirs inside source? Anyhow, shouldn\\\'t this be a cool feature for Octopress to support?
