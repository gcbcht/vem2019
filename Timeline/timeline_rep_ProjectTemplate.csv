Perhaps your organisation or department has a standard set of analysis flow, reports or directory structure that you need to adhere to.  They can be set up once, and everyone can use them consistently across projects.  First of all, you set up a directory on your local system containing just the things you want to add to a standard layout (maybe a replacement, perhaps a new  ).  Whatever you put in this folder will be merged into newly minted projects.  You can choose to overwrite files, or add new ones alongside.  Then you simply do: Each time you now issue the command  a new project is created that also incorporates your template automatically.  You can have as many templates as you want.  just type to see what\'s currently installed.  If you have a particular template that you use a lot, you can set it to be the default: after which, every time you do that template will be automatically applied, saving you some typing.  There is also the ability to use a template that someone has shared on github maybe a scripted workflow for a particular problem domain.  To do this, you first add it to your template collection: This is a template I have created to assist with text data mining and analysis.  If you now do then you will have a new project structure specifically tailored to get you started with text mining.  If you do this yourself as an example, you\'ll find a README which explains how to use this particular template to help analyse a big corpus of text.  By including the github option, I hope to enable the community to easily share analysis work flows among each other.  It also allows the functionality of to be extended and customised for lots of different situations without needing to have the core code updated.

ProjectTemplate,187,closed,body,2017-01-14 16:39:39,00:00,1,,,b'b\' First of all, sorry for the rather largish PR. # Background While testing PR #178 (to be able to ignore files) an issue surfaced that sometimes data was loaded from cache even though the source was ignored. This happens because the cache loading and data loading are two completely separate stages in  . Also, the older issues #137 / #140 point out that converting to doesn\\\'t work properly when the actual variable name is different from the variable name suggested by the file name. Furthermore, from a maintenance standpoint in its current form is rather hard to read as some of the actions are implemented within the function, while other actions are dispatched to separate functions. Also, some optimisation is possible by not looping over the for every file separately. # General solution To overcome the inconsistent behaviour of ignoring datasets all available data should be gathered in a single function, in which also should be determined whether the cached state is valid, what reader should be used if necessary, etc. In the and functions should be integrated into one function that loads the data from cache if possible and otherwise uses the predetermined reader to load the data from source. The problem of readers generating different variable names from the suggested variable name can be overcome by determining the difference in which variables exist right before and after the reader is called. That way only the new variables are processed in further steps. These new variables can then be converted to if necessary. While changing the functionality of the data  it is nice to extract this functionality into separate functions to make the logic behind the function more clear. # Implementation This PR provides the following new functionality:  ## Major changes: All new function that shows a list of the files and variables that will be loaded by  , including meta data such as its cache state and the configured reader. It can be called before loading the project as long as it\\\'s provided the configuration. All changes were implemented using test driven development, so there are more lines of tests than new code and every aspect of the function should be tested under different circumstances. (  is not exported) All new function that wraps calls to and (  is exported," but is useful mostly for debugging ignore patterns and determining which reader will be used) Merged into by using the new function. This makes the loading process much more efficient. The separate ""Loading cache"" stage is removed", and now shows whether the data was loaded from source or cache.

The function is the true workhorse that is also called by my new version of  , it builds the definitive list of all variables that should be loaded into memory. By building a list with both the cached and raw variables the ignore patterns are applied more consistently. Also, I noticed some performance improvement in the tests since a few of the original loops are vectorised now (for example the whole list of available readers is processed just once instead of for every variable separately).  I\'m sorry it\'s such a long list of changes, but by itself doesn\'t make much sense (especially when it\'s listing different things from what\'s actually loaded), while it\'s essential to the rewritten data loading phase.

ProjectTemplate,187,closed,5,2017-01-14 16:39:39,319.55,,,1,"b'b"" The changes in whitespace are (a bit) annoying", I agree, but is the effect of the RStudio project settings. I think the latest version of RStudio started to change sourcefiles according to those settings on saving the file because I do not remember that occuring unless code was actually copy-pasted. It\'s not that I want to start a white space war, but we might want to consider a standard (the project\'s defaults are 2 spaces, I prefer 4 but use the 2, and I think @connectedblue uses 8). I\'m not sure how best to resolve this issue that keeps popping up. I noticed though that the changes are visible more clearly in split view than in the default unified view.  Regarding  : The only real changes are the added function (which  at a later point be adapted for better cache invalidation) and the removal of as it is no longer a separate stage in  . I very much respect the improvements of the caching mechanism you made, and the heart of the cache loading was simply copied into the new version of the function. I do not mean to change the file just to have my name tagged on it :-)  could be removed without too much trouble, but I think the is a large improvement of the  / . It\'s not that  /  could not exist without changing the loading process but that there were inconsistencies in the loading process with previously cached data loaded if ignored later. That was an issue that was caught during the testing of #178. The only way around that, before the introduction of  , was to disable either auto caching or loading from cache at all.  With the new functionality the list of all available variables is compiled once, ignored where appropriate, and marked whether it is cached. That\'s all very nice, but if the actual loading of the data does something different there is no point in adding this function. The other way around, changing without makes no sense either. Therefore I changed simultaneously, which as a bonus reduced some overhead as well. Some of the minor changes to could perhaps be moved to another PR, but I\'m not sure it\'s that easy or that the separate PR will be much clearer with the moved lines. I do think the separation of into functions representing the main components is better, even though it doesn\'t change user functionality. The code is much cleaner now and easier to maintain, and perhaps all the if statements that remain in should move to the separate functions as well.  I do not agree with you that changes that make the code cleaner without changing user functionality should be avoided. Consider being a new developer who wants to see what does. Previously it was a long list of code with some actions dispatched to other functions while other things were happening inline. Now it is a small list of functions that is applied, with rather descriptive names that show exactly what happens in which order. As said, the is mostly a debugging tool that helps in cases like you experienced with the ignore patterns in reviewing #178. If you prefer to not export the functionality at all that\'s fine by me, but all tests have to be rewritten to either or to point to  . Changing to is not much work at all and keeps the tests to a single unit of functionality (great!), but then we are also testing internal functions (not so great..). Changing to is much more involved and only tests user functions (great!), but then again it is more an integration test than a unit test (not so great..) where effects are tested indirectly without being sure  changes to affect  .  Again, I\'m sorry it seems like a massive rewrite, which is made worse by the visualisation of the diffs," but I still think it\'s a consistent set of changes which isn\'t easily broken down into smaller pieces that are clearer. I would therefore prefer to keep the PR as it is unless you or @KentonWhite could point out some logical subsets of the changes that can be applied without manually rewriting everything as upstream changes were incorporated in the commits at least twice (apparently the link between the commits in a PR and the upstream master is broken when squashing commits once the PR is merged).""'"

I must admit I haven\\\'t delved into the new structure in the raw file I was trying to understand from the diff files only to build up a picture of the changes.  This is where it got confusing for me.  I\\\'ll go and look at the clean source files.  I\\\'m not sure either how it can be split up.  The PR was about a function, but now I think you\\\'re saying that the change is really about refactoring to make it more maintainable.  I don\\\'t have a particular view of the maintainability or otherwise of the current structure.

Also," the real variable names are passed to the conversion function.  I must say the issue of the being called after the contents were loaded from cache isn\'t fixed by this.

Regarding your first sentence: So this is saying that if should be ignored in then it should also be ignored in  ?  This is a little more subtle In normal operation, there would be no value in the cache because it was never loaded in the first place.  If however, as a user I want to create a variable called in a munge script and cache it to help load faster, then I should be able to do that. In other words, should only apply to files in the directory.  Whatever the use wants to  put in the cache," should be up to them. '""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I do agree there might be edge cases where files are always ignored (such as  )  but a variable is cached during munging that matches that ignored filename.

The current implementation is a convenience and not a proper package manager. Reproducible research is important.  has a key role in reproducible research providing a unified framework for data loading", munging, and reporting.  A second component is package management.  This creates a reproducible environment.  This is more complicated than running when a package is missing (which is what does).  Here are the key features of a package manager for reproducible research that are beyond the scope of  : Install from sources other than CRAN.  This includes GitHub and even private packages Handle package conflicts.  This issue is highlights that importance.  Sometimes packages depend on conflicting packages, so loading one will interfere with loading others. Handle package versions.  This is the most important step for reproducible research.  Older versions of packages may have features or bugs that are no longer available or present in the current version.  Simply loading the current CRAN version does not guarantee that the analysis will be reproduced.  We had a good discussion on including a package manager in  .  On the pro side of this was that is opinionated.  Some in the community wanted to have an opinion on how package management should be handled and which package manager is preferred.  On the con side there were just too many use cases.  With the different repositories and complexities of each project, picking a single package manager was too confining. In the end we agreed that works well **in tandem** with a package manager of your choice.  The precedent is other communities, like Ruby which have Rails (the framework) and Bundler (the package manager) and Python, which has PIP separate.  A package manager like does all of this management for you automatically.

ProjectTemplate,277,closed,3,2018-09-14 05:20:17,427.75,,1,,"b'b\' Thanks @Hugovdberg for looking into this.  The documentation says that the default ""auto"" uses ""radix"" for short numeric vectors", integer vectors," logical vectors and factors. Otherwise it uses ""shell"".  The biggest difference between ""shell"" and ""radix"" is that ""radix"" uses the [local comparison]url  while ""shell"" uses a hard-coded comparison.  This would give ""shell"" a slight performance boost for characters and why it was chosen.  it also explains why it failed in this example.  The Chinese character ordering is not defined in ""shell"" but radix uses the ordering for the location where it is defined.  I don\\\'t see any any obvious problem moving to ""radix"".  In general", Project Template recommends starting each file with a number, so moving to radix shouldn\\\'t affect most projects.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
