plupload,363,closed,body,2011-09-01 08:08:26,00:00,1,,,"b'b"" The current stable Safari for Windows has a bug that causes the upload of multiple files through the HTML5 runtime to fail.

When more than one file is selected the file sizes are set to 0"," the modification time is also set to 0.  The resulting upload through the FormData object will upload a zero length (i.e. empty) file. This bug does not seem to be a web-kit bug as the latest Chrome does not have the same problem. I\'ve logged an issue with Apple against Safari. I\'ve also created a basic test case that uses the same technique to upload files that plupload does using HTML5 on Safari.

The plugin is embedded into an upload control, and the testing page can be found here: url  this uses the uncompressed JS, so you can see how the Plupload is instantiated and events are bound. When you click somewhere inside the widget it asks for the authorization, you can create an account.Then please use any small video file, upload it you should see the blue progress bar below the file name. I have to bind to the FileUploaded event because I need the server response for some pieces of information about the file registered on the server side.The file is uploaded to Amazon, then on server response I send an AJAX request to our server finalizing the upload, and then after the success the video details editing screen is shown. Sometimes it works, but more often the upload is stuck (often at 100%," sometimes somewhere in the middle).

As a followup: I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m using v2 of the YouTube API, since v3 is not yet frozen, and following the browser-based uploading pattern described here:url  For this pattern, YouTube claims the expected response is a 301 (Moved Permanently) upon successful upload of a video, but in my experience the API actually issues 302 (Found).url  Most other successful YouTube API interactions result in 200 or 201, just not uploading. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m basing the interaction partially on source for the CORS example page:url  I post some XML to youtube to create a video object on their end with particular metadata. They return a single-use url to upload the file to, along with a permission token. The token and URL setting works, and plupload uploads the file to youtube successfully (it shows up on my youtube profile), but the response from youtube never gets through and the connection is aborted. The response following a successful upload should be the aforementioned 302, with the ID of the new video as one of the get params of the Location header URL. I guess I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not entirely aware if the browser even lets you intercept 301/302 responses and access the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLocation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d header. Reading the w3 spec it sounds like the expected behavior is to transparently follow the redirect.url url  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s possible there is a cross-site issue and that I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not setting headers correctly, but I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t think that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the problem. Examining the request-response cycle with the Chrome Inspector or Wireshark shows that it seems to work OK, but is aborted by Plupload or possibly the browser.

The issue: Using jquery ui in thumbs view, Only in IE (IE9 and below for sure, haven\'t tested in 10), with the Flash runtime, if you try to add an image to the queue with a resolution of about 6500x6500 and above it fails to load the image, which in turn breaks the entire upload. The flash button disappears and whatever you click you\'ll get an error. FF (in flash mode) will load the image and even generate the preview regardless of how big the file is. I\'ve traced it down to line 752 of jquery ui plupload: = function() {  ($(\'#\' +  + \' .plupload_file_thumb\', )[0], { .... In IE the onload never gets called for these files, neither does the .onerror. I\'m looking for any way to let the user upload those files, even if the preview failed.

However, it seems like that introduced a new issue that you will want to look at on Add Files, select multiple files one that you know will generate a preview, and at least 2 that are too big. The css is covering it up since you have overflow:hidden, but if you firebug the generated preview, you\'ll see that it was generated pretty much 1 + (numBigFiles 1) times.  The issue is coming from  = function().. I think it might have to do with the fact that regular errors are triggered immediately, while resolution issues trigger much later. I changed line 1019 from cb() to: if (ext[1] != \'jpg\' && ext[1] != \'png\' && ext[1] != \'jpeg\') cb(); It seems to do the trick, but I was mostly guessing," so I\'m not sure that\'s the best approach.

It seems my ""formula"" is a bit wrong. It\\\'s actually generated 1 + (numBigFiles before this one in the queue 1). You can test this way:1. Grab url 2. Copy file 3 times", rename them to 1.jpg, 2.jpg etc3. Find an img you know will generate a preview, rename to 5.jpg4. Open the jquery ui queue in , add all 5 files at once5.

plupload,855,closed,body,2013-08-07 23:14:53,00:00,1,,,"b'b\' I\\\'m upgrading our install of plupload 2.x from an older version to the current 2013-07-05 build. (plupload_2_0) When I set the runtimes to just \\\'silverlight\\\' I get a ""Upload URL might be wrong or doesn\\\'t exist"" error. I\\\'m getting this error on all browsers I test on. Now", the same script works when I use either HTML5, or Flash. I don\\\'t get the URL not found error. To be clear," html5 and flash are able to successfully access my \\\'plup_\\\' script and upload large files (20+mb).  I\\\'m assuming that this error message is referring the the ""url: plup_"" in the configure file", but it may also some error with Silverlight in general. My current install of plupload works with silverlight. It was installed sometime early 2013 or late 2012. (it\\\'s also some variant of 2.x) My upload handler script is \\\'plup_\\\' and is in the base director of the page that is calling plupload. As mentioned," it successfully uploads via both html5 and flash. The script below is essentially the same as my prior code except now I\\\'m using \\\'\\\' rather than just \\\'\\\'.  I have confirmed that /-2013-08-06/ is both readable and \\\'exists\\\' where it says it does. Here\\\'s the error message I\\\'m seeing (it only stays on the screen for a fraction of a second before the page \\\'refreshes\\\' and it goes away.)![error]url  Here is my header info. \\\'pt_ui_\\\' is the file that contains the plupload jquery code listed above. I\\\'ve also tried putting the full path to the upload file. /root_web_ but that didn\\\'t help (in fact it broke the html5 and flash implementations.). I also tried ""/"" + ""plup_"" but that didn\\\'t make a difference either.\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
plupload,855,closed,1,2013-08-07 23:14:53,80.92,,1,,b'b\' Okay so upon further investigation, it seems like silverlight does not seem to be \\\'chunking\\\' correctly. I went back to the original jquery_ui_ code to test this. Irrespective of what filter you use, if the file is larger than the chunk size, I\\\'m getting the error that it\\\'s \\\'not finding\\\' the upload url. If I put a file in less than chunk size, then it ~does~ upload the file correctly. I modified filters to the following for testing: If I remove the filter entirely," I still get the same error. The error occurs the first time the script tries to reach the  script. I removed the test /plupload folder that was created by the  script when run successfully with flash or a file smaller than chunk size. The plupload silverlight runtime does ~not~ successfully call \\\'\\\' when it has to chunk.  This failure is evidenced by the fact that the  doesn\\\'t create a new \\\'plupload\\\' folder like it should when called for the first time without an existing folder.  ![test_silverlight]url  Notice on the above image that the error occurs approximately 12% through which corresponds roughly with when the first chunk should have been fired off.
