ccv,75,open,body,2013-12-15 20:10:55,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" Compiling for Raspberry Pi (ARMv6 hard-float", Raspbian) with clang, gave the following strange messages from the assembler: ...>>... The library would compile without errors, but programs using libccv would segfault for strange reasons (for example, [this]url  program segfaulted at ccv_write). [It turns out]url  that this occurs because clang was not targeting the correct architecture. Clang needs to be told explicitly which architecture to compile for. Adding the following to the makefile in / seems to solve the problem. CFLAGS += -ccc-host-triple armv6-unknown-eabi -march=armv6 -mfpu=vfp -mcpu=arm1176jzf-s -mtune=arm1176jzf-s -mfloat-abi=hard  The flags set above were a little overkill, but perhaps ccv would benefit from telling the compiler which architecture to compile for, even when clang isn\'t used. I would have submitted a pull request, but I don\'t know enough about build settings and  to make these changes. If accommodating different architectures isn\'t worth it," I think ccv should at least turn assembler messages like the ones above into errors.

I normally work at a very high level (.NET), so I was wondering if you could say a bit more about getting ccv up and running on a Pi? For example," the CFLAGS line is added just under the existing CFLAG line in the makefile ... correct? What else needs to be done to compile for the Pi? (btwI\'m actually using Arch if that makes any difference). I\'m hoping for a step-by-step set of instructions that I can follow. Thanks in advance ""'",,,,,,,

ccv,75,open,4,2013-12-15 20:10:55,552.08,,,1,"b'b"" From that error message", it looks like there might be a typo in the makefile. If you want to compile the ccv library, you should look at the makefile in /lib instead of /bin. The /bin makefile only compiles the example programs that come with the library. The /lib makefile compiles the library itself.  Unfortunately, I don\'t have my pi anymore, so I can\'t tell you exactly how I got the library to compile. If you have a default pi with clang built from source, based on Liu Liu\'s setup," the library should compile out of the box.  Good luck!""'",,,,,
ccv,75,open,5,2013-12-15 20:10:55,271.72,,1,,"b'b"" Sidd", Thanks for getting back to me. I did make the mistake of being in the wrong directory initially. I caught myself fairly quickly by re-reading Liu Liu\'s Getting Started webpage. When adding your CFLAG line to makefile in /lib, I still get the same exception above. With regard to a possible typo, it\'s her file downloaded from the ccv website (I only added your CFLAG line under the existing CFLAG line in the makefile.) Her instructions say run in /lib. That results in: I don\'t know enough about compiler errors and makefiles to know what either this exception or the other is trying to tell me. What I can do is something that Liu Liu hints at: I do know how to strip out the C code for face detection and its internal dependencies from the package into my own C program, simplifying the whole thing down to one or a few files, then compile those individual files manually. Since she has this package setup to work without external dependencies, that procedure should work. If anyone has an idea on how to compile the whole package this for the RPi," I thank you in advance for tips. [btw I\'m on Arch Linux 3.12.26]""'",,,,

If you down-sample your PNG input image to PNG-8", it will go away; and it doesn\'t seem like the warning is that big of a deal anyway. It will run even if the warning appears.
