devtools,623,closed,body,2014-10-19 22:11:35,00:00,1,,,"b'b"" HiThis is similar to something I tried to raise in #550", but in the previous issue I confused two different aspects of my problem when I try to use the devtools package development sequence, so I am trying again, just concentrating on explaining the aspect that causes devtools to fail for me. If I create a simple example project and add two files in the R directory as followsa.r is  and b.r is  then when I try to run load_all() on this package I get the following error messages The problem arises because although I have the @include directive in my file a.r, it has not yet been processed, so load_all() attempts to read the code from the files in alphabetical order. I still get an error if I try and run devtools::document(\'.\'), as seen here And because of the error while loading, the document(\'.\') does not finish, and does not update the collate entry in the package DESCRIPTION file. A solution is to run roxygen2::update_collate() before trying to load_all() or document() my package The updated collate entry in the DESCRIPTION file created by roxygen2::update_collate tells load_all() (and all the other devtools machinery) the correct order to process the files in. I can avoid this problem myself now I know what causes it, but as an absolute novice package creator it really confused me for ages. In my real life example the alphabetic order of the file names was not so obvious, and when I tried to pin the error down by commenting out bits of code, it enabled devtools::document to run successfully.  Then when I removed the commenting out, the original code would behave nicely, making the problem appear only intermittently and very frustratingly.  It would be nice if some fix of the type I have illustrated could be included in the official devtools. Thanks Geoff  PS I\'m still pretty much a novice package creator (waiting keenly for the book to be finished and published), just a little more informed about this particular problem. PPS Because roxygen2::update_collate emits a message when it runs," I think simply adding a call to roxygen2::update_collate into the code for load_all may cause some of the testthat tests on devtools to fail (because they are not expecting that particular message to be there) PPPS I have tried to write a testhat for devtools to check that the collate order is _correct_ and up to date.  The testthat code is It requires a template project (which I have called testCollateOrder) with a plain vanilla DESCRIPTION file The key feature is that there is no collate entry in the file yet. The two files in the R directory are a.r and b.r The test will succeed if the @include directive has been recognised so that a.r is read after b.r""'",,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve hit a snag, which means I\'ve got some more thinking to do.  If you have any guidance to offer, it would be most appreciated.  **Edited in some thoughts about options (on Mon 11 Nov 2014) see below** It seems that overwrites the existing Collate field in the DESCRIPTION file, based on the directives that it finds in the files in the package directory. That\'s good for my situation :-)  (as I slowly build up the package I am working on, and tidy the functions into nice workable and maintainable code, I _want_ the Collate entries to be changed to reflect my latest file structure.) But if someone else has chosen to create their Collate entries by manually editing the DESCRIPTION file instead of using the roxygen2 directives, this will wipe out their entries, and make them unhappy :-( It may need a bit more work to figure out which situation applies and hence to _guess_ what the user actually wants to do.  Regards Geoff PS This has been a really good example for me to appreciate the value of the testthat approach to development.  I figured this out only after I started to try and work out why some of the existing expectations in were failing after I added the call to in my forked branch of devtools. # Edited in thoughts about possible approaches I can think of three possible approaches, none feel really good.  The last one (3b) seems the least worst to me. ## Options1. Mandate that if the collate order matters to your package and you want to use devtools then either: 1a. You must use and cannot edit the DESCRIPTION file collate field by hand or 1b. You cannot and must edit the DESCRIPTION file collate field by hand2. Add a new argument to devtools::load_all which indicates whether or not you want the collate field to be generated from directives; make sure that all internal uses of are aware of this, and pass the appropriate argument through3.

devtools,649,closed,6,2014-11-16 01:50:28,1120.78,1,,,"b'b"" Hi @hadley  Many thanks for looking over this pull request so quickly. I\'ve removed the message from the  ", and deleted the explicit version check on  . I am still nervous about deleting the roxygen2 version check, because although I cannot build devtools with an outdated version of roxygen2, I can install it in a library which has an outdated version of roxygen2 and run it with that outdated version.  I can supply an example if that would be useful.  It is because of a bug (OK perhaps a design feature) in how base R (as at 3.1.2) does (or doesn\'t do) dependency checks on Imports packages (dependency checks are **only** applied to DESCRIPTION file Imports packages which are also mentioned in the NAMESPACE file).  I\'ll accept whatever you decide is best," of course :-) Geoff""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
