From over here," I\\\'d say the biggest issue is that its not ""natural"".

The other issue is that the docs point to a page where most of the language isn\\\'t implemented yet.. (I added a page to the main wiki with what is implemented, translated from a german link I got off IRC. I haven\\\'t checked to see if its complete, but from my experience it is.) A lesser contributing issue is the lack of preview there is no way to see if you guessed correctly on formatting.. To bring this back home a little, an editor would allow things like smart link processing \\\'insert link\\\' offer url shortening, titles, etc. And it makes it obvious to the user every time what features are and are not available without forcing them to learn yet another formatting language.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We also keep the ""x","y"" coordinates of the top left corner for each faces. 4All faces should be automatically blurred on the picture and saved like that on the server (to prevent any browser plugin to bypass the blurring system", and prevent the right-click / save picture option). 5Diaspora notify each tagged persons to ask them the autorisation to show their face on this picture. 6The picture is immediatly visible on the user publisher wall / album, but every faces are blurred. The list of users tagged on the picture are not yet visible for the public. 7Each tagged user have received a notification," and they can answer ""I Accept"" or ""I Refuse"". (future options : always accept from this contact", accept only for my mutual friends or friends in aspect X,Y,Z etc...) 8When a tagged user accept, then his name is show under the picture, and his small picture is now show on the top of the global picture," to the exact ""x","y"" coordinates. Then he can again change is mind", and refuse again," or re-accept later etc. May be a special link ""download picture"" could be usefull", where we generate a picture of the current visible state.

But IMHO the problem of dying pods is larger than the problem of moving pods. Users must be protected by _automatic_ backup and fault tolerance. Not everybody is a techie that will remember to download their export every week. I think the  process makes the network hugely more fault tolerant. It doesn\\\'t just allow moving pods, the point is to protect identities.Nowhere in the proposal it says users have to decide anything the network takes care of that. But they have the option of choosing also, if they want to do simply a move without any disaster forcing them to. They can always move from their new location after a disaster.To reduce the amount of code and to keep it more simple, yes. Of course the migration process could be outside the restore process," but why? The end result is the same. If we want a separate ""import and migrate"" process as documented in your link", of course that could still be done, and they could share some of the same code.

If the old pod is still alive the new pod could fetch all the pictures I guess? Or if we have an import process, the user could always import them to their new account.

That encrypted base tarball could be included in the user export as well as automatically backed up. The import codepaths would only be different up to the point of having obtained that tarball and handing it to the user identity migrator. The importer of the user uploaded data could then simply proceed with importing other present data while the automatic backup importer would be done by then.

Before implementing automatic , we must introduce protocol changes and the restore feature itself. Manual restore doesn\'t require any other changes, while automatic restore requires some additional features so it\'s natural to implement manual restore and only after that add the automatic  capability. Therefore, my spec doesn\'t have details on the automation, but on all the other things I described. I have already received the review of the spec from @jhass. I\'m waiting for a review by @denschub to move forward with the implementation. Also, for the record, here are (currently WIP) PRs that are related to this issue resolution: #6726," #6750.

What if a businessman wants to use diaspora\\\\* and often travels between Europe and US. So when he selects a US pod he\'ll have lag from Europe", and vice versa. Considering migration stuff etc. wouldn\'t it make sense that a person can manage the pods that  is using?  For example: I know I\'m often traveling between Japan, Europe and US. I\'d like my data to be on pods in each of those areas so I won\'t suffer lag. Subsequently, data would be synced between these selected pods. This also guarantees some resilience in case one server dies. There comes into play another problem: Logging into your account. A great feature would be to be able to login to your pod from one website (which knows which email belongs to what pod(s) somehow) and automatically routes you to the correct pod. Otherwise you\'d need to switch between different websites all the time -A further connected issue: I just signed in to diaspora and saw that there\'s an e-mail with ones name attached to the pod. Not sure what it is used for actually," but what is that e-mail worth if it\'s going to change when migrating to another pod (or using multiple pods)?

By design diaspora currently requires a user to have an account on the home pod which is an entry point to the diaspora network. Changing this assumption would require reconsideration of many design points and it is non-obvious. Introduction of serious design changes requires a strong reason. Pod access time of some frequently travelling person doesn\'t seem to me serious enough to justify the network design shift. If this is an real issue for someone, a more appropriate and less radical solution may be worked out.

Unfortunately, Gist does not send notification for new comments, so that\\\'s meh.) Hi Senya, please find my feedback to your specification below. Thank you very much for your work. It is unclear to me if you intend to use this document for diaspora only or if you plan on having a general migration definition for other social networks as well. If it\\\'s the latter, this spec misses a lot of details. (I added this paragraph after writing everything else). We probably should clear that first. What do you wanna do here? Initially, we talked about a migration process that would work for other networks as well. This document looks like a plan of what diaspora needs to do," which is not the same. I just read the entire thing and I still don\\\'t have an idea on how this is supposed to work in detail. Please put the ""process description""", that is, the needed steps first," followed by the details. Take a look at the [OpenID flow examples]url  for example. There is no need to differentiate between ""frontend"" and ""backend"" steps here. Write the directions as unbiased", simple, and neutral as possible. For example (just wrote that, this is not the actual flow.)1. User initiates the account migration process by entering the new servers URL.2. The old server sends a AccountMoveRequested to the new server.3. The new server sends a Profile to the old server.4. After the old server imported the profile, an user archive is created and a link to the download is provided to the user.5. The user uploads the archive to the new server.6. The new server sends a AccountImportCompleted message to the old server.7. The old server deletes the user account and marks the profile as moved. And so on. Here is the original feedback, but I guess we should define our goals first...I hope that this was meant to be as a joke. If not," I sincerely am disappointed that I am the only one seeing the reason for having a very complex and very risky featured and its underlying principles spec\\\'ed and discussed.Nit: ""communicate with each other""Are you sure that there is no difference? I imagine merging data created by two different keys with different signatures being quite edgy.Other implementations will not read our source to understand the resulting XML. Please add the actual XML that has to be send on user moves or we\\\'ll never see anyone else being compatible with our stuff.I assume this is talking about the ""account ID"" (or", as we know it, the diaspora handle)?Please specify that a **permanent** redirect should be used, just to be sure.If we\\\'re able to determinate that the user moved right in the receive step, we could return an error code and the pod would automatically retry. But I doubt we\\\'d be able to do this. :/How does the new pod get the users details like profile information," email addresses? What about the users password? Should we send a password recovery email immediately after the account creation?""Tombstone"" is not a verb and even if it would be", it\\\'s ambiguous. Please specify that the origin pod has to remove all user contents and the profile. Step seems duplicated with step 3. Also, link to GitHub is not permanent," press the y key on GitHub to make it reload with an URL that contains the latest revision.What are ""all"" references? Where is the person used? How does the old pod get the new profile after it\\\'s created (do we fetch?). After all", most entities are related to a person which we don\\\'t know about after some federation happened.Wondering about the timeline. Alice starts the migration from Source to Target. When does the import happen? When does the migration happen? Is the archive import a step that can be done after the account is moved? If so (as specified later in the document)," how can ""The archive owner\\\'s account is not closed"" be a validation argument? I am totally lost about the actual import stap. In ""Backend migration process"" you write that the ID change procedure needs to be done before importing the archive. However", the archive includes the users details, which we need to create the new account. I fear we deadlock\\\'ed here.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,

There is no such claims neither in the previous version of the spec", nor in the new. Archive import is performed along with the moving process, it may begin just after the new user record has been created, and the AccountRename federation message is only sent when the archive is already imported.Archive is validated before the migration process ever started. I see no deadlocks here. We read the archive when the user provides it at the very beginning and use data from it to create a new account. The ID change doesn\\\'t depend on the archive data, except of the step where the federation message is sent to the contacts, which can easily be postponed until the import is finished.

We should block new messages if the account is closed, but I\'m not sure if we should allow exceptions. For example still allow retractions: The AccountDeletion only deletes posts, not comments (and that\'s intentional). If you still have your private key and want to remove a specific comment, that would then theoretically be possible with manual things to send a retraction. I also don\'t think we have a disadvantage to still allow to receive retractions from closed accounts, because for the migration, all content was migrated away from the old person, so a evil old podmin can\'t do any harm by sending retractions, because the author doesn\'t match anymore.  But I also that think that\'s something that doesn\'t need to be added to 0.7.0.0 (it\'s already frozen and it\'s nothing critical.

Federation is not yet at the point at which everyone on every pod will reliably see the most up-to-date data. If you can\'t be sure that you will be shown the latest, accurate information on who is attending an event or even be sure that the date, time and venue information you are shown is accurate (because if someone changed it since it was originally federated to your pod, you might not be seeing the latest version), an events feature is next to useless. Of course someone is welcome to create it, but everyone who used it would have to use it with the caveat that they might be seeing incorrect information. To my mind that is likely to be such a big problem that it is likely to be a blocker to such a feature being merged into the main code base. To have a feature in Diaspora which was \'broken\' in this way would be likely to put many people off using Diaspora. Of course, the situation would be different in the case where everyone involved in an event was on the same pod (say a pod run for a club or society), as federation wouldn\'t be an issue. It might be that the best thing is for someone to create in a fork an events feature which will work only on individual pods," and podmins who wanted to implement it only for their pod\'s members could pull that fork.

diaspora,1359,open,49,2011-07-08 01:45:13,1259.62,,1,,"b'b"" Hey @efstrian ! This feature is very much requested", thank you for your interest in working on it! Before you start hammering out too much code, it would be a fantastic idea to draw up a little plan on what exactly needs to be done and how it will be done. This makes sure that you don\'t write a huge amount of code that cannot be used. Also, when you start writing code, _please_ create a pull request with the code in the _very early stages_, so we can follow the progress and give comments. There is nothing worse than someone writing lots of code and then the core team saying it cannot be used.. ;) As for the feature, I\'d suggest splitting the implementation into as small pieces as possible. Maybe something like; Phase 1 Models and initial implementationCreate, update and view events  This includes all the bits needed to not only create the event but also how it is shown in the stream, single post view, mobile, etc. Personally I think you could follow up how polls work, so events would be just additional details to a normal status message object. So instead of having some Facebook type dedicated very different Event object, just allow the attachment of Event specific details _to_ a status message. This should be talked through before implementing so that we are clear what events actually are.Participate in an eventView upcoming eventsNo invitations at this stage though event post can be shared like any otherNo editing of events at this stage, but of course they can be commented on. Phase 2 Event invitationsInvite other users to an eventProcess received invitation Phase 3 Event maintenanceEditing an event. Note this would require, if made as a status message, first editing functionality to appear. It is being worked on so it should be ready this hopefully Phase 4 AdministratorsAdd / remove administrators Splitting the feature into smaller tasks will allow for it to be implemented earlier and with less danger in breaking other parts. Also, it is important to note that in all steps federation needs to be considered. Before deciding on the models and features for events you need to consider how the federation layer will be changed to support those features. I strongly feel events should be additional implementation on top of status messages," not completely separate objects. What do others think? ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Events could be such a feature as others have mentioned, but that means making events better than exists today, not just copying what\\\'s already is out there.  Today I look for events in many places: I subscribe to some public calendars, there are FB events, meetup events, some are shared via email and some via some specialized services. With a good implementation, most of these could happen on D*.  Make it possible to post a public calendar to D* and then D* will mirror the calendar\\\'s events in the future. The sender is the poster or group (when those arrive). Let the poster add missing fields (like one theater\\\'s public calendar data could be complimented with the address and name of the theater, links to the home page etc). When groups arrive, each event should have its own group connected of course for participants to discuss before and after the event, just like meetup & FB events.  With an embeddable web view for the published calendar, the publisher could get the ability to have comments," increasing D*s exposure. This would also bring in ""free"" content and it would increase the value of a public calendar. This is not something FB or meetup can do today I think.  A public calendar could be posted by just posting the calendar\\\'s URL. Add some field under the post for the user to add default content for the events (like address", URL," title etc). There could be a link back from events to the ""calendar publishing"" for the publisher to  the calendar later on (and then chose to remove future events or all events).  When a user publishes a public calendar that someone else has already published", allow it," but mention it for the user. ""It has been published before"," subscribe instead?"". Having the calendar published fewer times makes discussions about the events more  (""Hey", is anyone going to the show from X," can I ride along?"" etc)", but the first to publish it should not monopolize it, preventing the owner of the public calendar from later publishing it to D* or requiring manual intervention.  Make it possible to search & subscribe (recurrent search) to events filtered on , distance  publisher. With FB their algorithms decide for you, making you miss events. Although sometimes good, many want better control.  With FB events you never know how many people show up. It has become better," but now people just press ""interested"" and sometimes still show up. ""Interested"" gives good info", but there should be the possibility of a RSVP with a deadline as well. FB doesn\\\'t deliver that," hence specialized web services for that or manually through email in many cases. FB also falls short when an event cost money and you have to pay in advance. Have a ""confirmed"" etc checkbox for the event organizers to check", when needed.  Posting a poll and then posting an event is annoying and you lose interested people. Let it be possible to post an event with a few different times, people check those that are possible for them and at a deadline the most common one is selected. After that people say if they are going.  A D* event should have an URL, making it easy to publish on FB etc. That\\\'s another way to get more D* users. If it was a one click deal of joining D* via an existing FB etc account and you could publish your new event as a post with a link back on  etc," that would bring more users to D*. ""I\\\'ll have a house warming party"," click here for details""", or something like that. Users of FB click the link, see a button to sign up&in with FB as well as the sign in page (unless already signed in) and after that click (and perhaps FBs authorization page) they see the posted event in all its glory, that would bring in new users.\'',,,,,,

Should we test both? You can see the code here: url  lines 42 and 49. Accordingly, we would need to change the condition in the worker url  line 14). 2. In the worker we are iterating over all the profiles that are in a pod in order to check their birthday. We were wondering if it would be more efficient to add an index for the birthday, what do you think? 3. We added to the  page a checkbox to enable the user not to get birthday notification emails.

Mentions are allowed for both. (Currently ok)The block feature means: I don\\\'t see their posts, commentaries, reshares and likes; and vice versa. Mentions are not allowed among us. (new feature) Ignore is about close my stream of their posts only. We continues seeing their commentaries, likes and reshares. It is just because their posts usually are not too much interesting for me. There is not other problem. Their commentaries in my post and post from a third person if I see this post I assume that I am interested in their commentaries too, it could be more or less interesting even could make some misunderstanding without it. So currently I don\\\'t see any bug. Block is about close both streams: They don\\\'t see my posts, reshares, likes, commentaries and vice versa. Here is not about preferences in my stream, is about a specific or real problem between two users. So D\\\\* doesn\\\'t need to hide any reaction between both because directly there is not post to do it. It include original posts reshared. Mentions are not allowed in any case, none of two could do it because they wouldn\\\'t see it, because they would have no right of reply," because create an exception to be able to comment a mention would be meaningless just because you are blocking. Is more complex on post from each other. I would add here only one option: ""Make my reactions invisibles"":Visible: it would be when both know there is a hided commentary"," both see if like the post or commentary. The blocker is still able to click and show their hided commentary like a exception; the blocked only would see something like ""You are not authorized to see it"". Both see reshares here even when they are the last one in reshare", because the post come from others users. Invisible: both don\\\'t realize of any hided commentary; both don\\\'t see their likes; both don\\\'t see reshares only when they are the last one in reshare, because when they are already inside of the string they don\\\'t realize if one of them participated.

diaspora,1734,closed,16,2011-08-05 09:22:53,369.58,1,,,b'b\' @Pistos Thanks again.  From a user\\\'s perspective, ignore and block are different features.  Ignore: I\\\'ve added you to an aspect," but don\\\'t really want to see your posts. I do not mind if you to see mine though.  Block: This is meant to prevent someone from abusing another user. 1. Both users are removed from each other\\\'s aspects if they were in any.2. No sharing in either direction. 3. No private messages.4. No mentions. 5. Blocked user cannot see my public posts.6. Blocked user cannot see my profile. 7. My profile cannot be found by search for a person or a hashtag.  I do not agree that I should have a ""blocked aspect"" because that implies that I am interacting with the person in some way. If it was set up this way", would that mean the person I want to block gets a notification that I\\\'ve added  to an aspect? Blocking, to me, means no contact at all.

diaspora,1734,closed,17,2011-08-05 09:22:53,362.57,1,,,b'b\' Here are my thoughts on the **_**_ issue: If you\\\'ll indulge me while I get a little philosophical. ;) First, as I\\\'ve said in several other threads and contexts, I am totally against censorship, but unfortunately," this ""freedom"" also necessarily means that some nefarious types are going to abuse it by abusing others\\xe2\\x80\\x94Several people close to me (myself included) have experienced this abuse"," and it really messes with our ability to enjoy this community. This ""freedom"" (which I advocate) also means that there are few repercussions or consequences for those who choose to be abusive  threatening. I do not like the idea of podmins being moderators and watching  ""Big Brother""-style"," in order to ""protect the innocent."" They should not be moral gatekeepers. It\\\'s tough enough just keeping the pods running (can I get a whut whut", @Pistos?? ;) ) Having said that, each of us should be empowered with tools to _protect ourselves_ online. So, if Johnny Troll tells me that he\\\'d happily put a bullet in my head, because he thinks the world would be better off without me, well, I would like the ability to **never ever** hear from him again. I don\\\'t really care if some of his ideas and posts are actually fairly insightful. Now, I don\\\'t necessarily want to  Johnny Troll, but I want to be able to lock him out of my (virtual) house, and not worry about him  me again. This is not censorship. This is not crowdsourcing (which could be abused). This is me taking control of my little corner of D*. People should have every right to express themselves, even be assholes online if that\\\'s their flavour. I don\\\'t really care. But, I should be empowered to not have to deal with them. So here are my suggestions: First," several levels of **_IGNORE**_:Already implemented is the ""Ignore Johnny Troll"" and the ""Hide and mute post"" options", which are a good start. I would like to see it go a step further," where Johnny Troll\\\'s comments are flagged and _""censored""_"," #nsfw style for **_me**_ (though visible for anyone who has _not_ ""ignored"" them). So", if Johnny Troll has posted a comment on Jenny Friend\\\'s (who is a friend of mine) post, then JT\\\'s comment, rather than being visible," will be ""hidden"""," with a note saying ""You have chosen to ignore Johnny Troll\\\'s posts and comments. **Click here** if you would like to see this comment."" **_BLOCK**_ \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Again"," not _censorship_ nor crowdsourced _""punishment""_"," but here\\\'s how I envision an effective ""block"" function. If I get a threat or harassment from Johnny Troll", I can **_BLOCK**_ him, and once that is activated, then, if he tries to comment on one of my posts, he gets a message saying,"You cannot comment on this user\\\'s posts."" Or something to that effect. Once I block someone, they are added to a list of **Blocked Users** on my settings page, any of whom can be _unblocked_ by me at any time. If ""Johnny Troll"" is really Johnny Curmudgeon, and there was just a misunderstanding, then JC can send a note to the podmin explaining the situation, and the podmin can contact the me, and I can then decide to unblock JC.Similarly, if Johnny Troll has seen the error of his ways, and wants to change, then, being a believer in forgiveness, I think JT should have the opportunity to try to reconnect\\xe2\\x80\\x94via the podmin route, as stated before. But in both cases, I have full control over how JT can interact with me. Two things need to be absolutely sacrosanct at D*1) People should feel _safe_ here.2) Trollish behaviour should not be without its consequences*And as stated before, _consequences_ does not mean some kind of podmin-originated banishment, nor crowd-sourced ""punishment", but rather, the trollee should be empowered to not have to interact with the troll.\'',,,,,

Let\'s say, for example, you\'re on Pod A and you ignore Jane Smith who\'s on Pod B. That ignore is only recorded on Pod A Pod B has no idea about it. Then, you post something public. It will get federated to Pod B because there are other users on that pod (who you have not ignored) who are following you. This means that the post will show up in Jane Smith\'s feed, if it has tags that she follows, and she\'ll be able to comment on it. However, when Pod B notifies your pod that there\'s a comment from Jane Smith, your pod will drop it because you\'re ignoring her, so that comment won\'t appear anywhere except Pod B.

I take it that once ""the arrow has left the bow"," there is simply no way to change a public to a private or vice versa. I am not speaking about the moral issues arising from doing such a thing, just the technological aspects. Is this right? If there is a way, what would that mean?2.

Most of the larger nonpods run modified code that isn\'t in the main codebase. To date, most of those modifications have been cosmetic, or adding minor features. However, in theory, a pod admin could make whatever changes they wanted. When you befriend someone on a remote pod, you are placing a certain amount of trust in their pod admin. That pod admin has access to all the data you send your friend. That pod admin may also be running different code from what\'s on your pod. In addition, their terms of service may allow them to treat your data differently than it is treated on your pod. We\'re working on better messaging around remote pods\' terms of service, so that when you are considering following someone on a remote pod, you can tell what their ToS allows them to do. All of this is important because once data leaves your pod, your options for changing it are limited. That\'s the nature of a distributed system. You\'re giving up the downsides of a centralized system: single point of failure, monolithic one-size-fits-all experience, and user-unfavorable policies. In return you get a robust system that\'s hard to kill, where the user experience can be customized to fit what you want, and where you can make informed choices about the policies you feel comfortable with. But you also take on the downsides of a distributed system: inconsistent user experience, less control over data once it leaves your node, and a spectrum of policies around data management to keep track of. As I said, we\'re still working on surfacing all the relevant information to the user in a way that is intuitive, in the right place, and makes sense. But that\'s what we\'re working towards. There\'s always the possibility that a hostile pod enters the ecosystem, or, more likely, that a pod with lax security is compromised and goes from being a white hat, so to speak, to being a black hat. That\'s a problem in centralized systems as well, and in those cases, generally, the attacker has access to the entire dataset. At least with a distributed system, a compromised pod only has access to a fraction of the total network. ""'
diaspora	1734	closed	42	madamephilosophe	2011-08-05 09:22:53	1396.9		+1		b'b\' Thanks again... But I\\\'m not sure from your reply how my questions are answered. So I will reflect back to you what I think you are saying and how it lines up with my questions.You seem to say (to me) that yes, as a whole once the message is published (by hitting the ""share"" button) the controls that have been selected by aspecting, direct how that post is handled by the decentralized system. What I imagined from what you depicted were different communication tubes, \\xc3\\xa1 la that scene in Sam Lowry\\\'s office in the movie Brazil.  :)  When you say that options are limited once it leaves my pod, what are my options? As far as I can tell from my experience on D\\\\* is that I can delete the post entirely (whether public or private).  That delete function seems to work like this:If I am the author of a post, I can delete any comments made to it, whether mine or someone else\\\'s (aside: however as Max indicates above, there is a bug right now that prevents anyone from deleting comments at all to one\\\'s own post). If I am not the author and I comment on another\\\'s post, I can only delete my own comments.  That seems to describe the basics of altering the original profile of a post. Is that fair to say? Is that comprehensive or are there caveats to that? Outside of that, what other options do I have? Off the top, it seems I can add people to aspects who would then be able to see the post at my profile page (not their stream) if they were not in my aspect crowd when I made the post. Is there anything else we should know?From your reply, it seems you are saying that it is possible for people to carve the code as they like for one\\\'s own pod. Essentially that is the lifeblood of open source software, so arguing that point of ""all code should be the same"" is really a fruitless one. But in terms of software design, I am not asking if it is possible to carve the code, but how difficult is it to bastardize the system that someone, who is on a pod that is not compliant with a privacy-safe rendering of the codebase, whom I\\\'ve unknowlingly or unwittingly shared with and who can then siphon my private post and corrupt its settings from being an aspected to a public one? I understand also that one of the things you to be saying is that you recognize there is need for some kind of evaluation system that is socially distributed, by providing a rubric to ""objectively"" evaluate the technical safety of a pod, as well as the reputation of a pod. But I also hear you saying there also needs to be a handshaking system among pods that allows pods to recognize good pods (or safe pods) from bad ones (or unsafe ones). So I am differentiating the social aspect from the technical one. I do understand there are pros and cons to a centralized vs de-centralized system. And I think it behooves anyone who moves off FB or Twitter to understand what they are doing by moving off D*.  Don\\\'t get me wrong. I am not proFB or any other Big Brother Social Network. But as it stands now, hypothetically anyway, my data on FB even though it is getting siphoned off by third party apps, and marketing creeps, is still housed in FB servers (as far as I know), and if there was a problem (that was a breach of their own TOS) I could sue FB for that breach and they would (I suppose) have to scrub their servers of the offending use of my data. Whether that is likely, is another discussion. But if a similar breech occurred on a D\\\\* network, anything off my pod is open shooting for anyone and I would have no recourse, because I would have to contend not only with ONE entity (as in the case of FB) but with as many entities as there are pods on the network. Right? So it means then if I am very concerned with this happening I should NEVER make a pubic post. In commenting upon something you said, I do not think it is possible to say that I as a user can customize my D\\\\* experience, because I cannot make public posts without a great risk. From what you say, there is no way to control my experience if I make public posts. So I would ask D\\\\* to reflect upon that and perhaps create more precise language about that.  For example, as far as informed decisions, I respectfully must disagree with you, because I was not aware that public posts meant public across the entire Internet, I did not know that my public posts were subject to SE indexing. I thought they were only public across the D\\\\* network. (I mean, I understand that NOW, but it was only a few weeks ago that I started to understand what happens when I make a public post, or even when I participate on someone else\\\'s public post). And I am still feeling uninformed as to whether if I delete a public post what the consequences are of doing that in the system.  To be fair, I understand that I am participating in an experiment, but I think that alpha users for being alpha users, should be given a fair shake, so that we can be some what assured we are not jeopardizing our online well-being by attempting to make a contribution to a larger good. If alpha users are treated with less care than airplane test pilots, no one except the most stupid users will participate. I include myself as a possible stupid user. I am hoping sincerely that I will not pay a price by contributing to the D\\\\* cause. I thank you again for your time to read my and make your comments. As well as your future response, if you have one.\''

We\'ll think about where the right place is to put that. Re: options after you create a post for modification, the only thing you can do is request that it be deleted. It may not be deleted by all the pods you send the request to. For example, if the pod is down, it won\'t get the request, and the post will still be there. We can fix that sort of thing with better timeouts and retrying and so forth. But other pods may just be running buggy code that fails to delete the post, or something like that.

Recently I have seen someone mention this issue and argue that diaspora developers have an obligation to accommodate people who want ""safe spaces.""  In case you are curious where I saw this discussion", it was [here]url Sadly, this discussion seemed to have most, if not all, commenters, supporting censorship.  The lack of understanding here is also important to note," where the poster claims: _""Blocking people allows for the creation of what each individual considers a safe space without this we are leaving the vulnerable to fend for themselves. Without this we set the stage for the creation of centrally managed safe spaces (as Twitter has recently advocated) which is completely in opposition to the philosophy of Diaspora.""_  I want to go on the record", as a diaspora user myself, who is willing to reject the sort of fallacious nonsense as the above statement. First, blocking people results in (if the person attempts to comment on your posts," something like)  ""You cannot comment on this user\\\'s posts.""  Ignoring means you cannot see a person\\\'s posts or comments anywhere.  As I understand it", if your posts are public, you are conveying that information to the crowd.  Private posts are for a specific set of people. Public posts," go public. The notion that blocking people allows for the creation of a ""safe space"" is incorrect.The notion that diaspora developers need to create ""safe spaces"" or to foster a condition where any individual can create what they consider ""safe spaces"" are incorrect.The notion that without this sort of censorship motive one would ultimately end up with ""centrally managed safe spaces"" is incorrect. I do imagine that for some people who find themselves being trolled incessantly and want a way to essentially disable this from happening", one part of the solution could be to make all your posts private," but admittedly this sounds like not the most ideal solution. One thing I do think needs fixing for sure is the ""Ignore vs. Block"," what happened"" as mentioned above by @unity100 ~ who said"," _""Im not able to block someone. Only option that exists in their profile is ignore.If Ignore option is actually block option"," then the interface is confusing in that regard""_ Personally", I\\\'ve never wanted to Ignore or Block anyone because I see Diaspora as a place where people can be free and where this shouldn\\\'t be necessary, even if I really don\\\'t agree with what I see, I can learn from what people are expressing.  But what if someone was threatening me with violence, for example?  (To be clear, this has never happened to me.)  So I looked around for a Block button, but could only find an Ignore in my case.  Again, perhaps this needs both an Ignore and Block as it seems the meaning of these two things is different," thus there should be a different button for each one. Diaspora is intended to allow people more room to maneuver than centralized systems such as twitter and facebook.  There is zero obligation for any developer to create a system which will allow you to create your own ""safe spaces"" ""safe spaces"" being an idea which functions all too often in order to allow some people to suppress free speech", open dialogue, and reasonable talk. Diaspora fosters the potential for free speech because of its distributed nature and the desire of the community to keep it truly free.  I\\\'d like to see that continued and not see it undermined. O.K., that\\\'s my two satoshis on the subject.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,

Obviously editing is desirable, but what about people breaking the conversation by changing something others have responded to in some way? Perhaps people who\\\'ve commented, liked, or reshared should be notified and those who\\\'ve reshared should have the option to update their reshare. In such a system notifications should only go out for significant changes, meaning more then just typo corrections. This could be defined as an amount of differences when compared but that would leave the system open to certain critical keyword changes though," like the word ""not"" or the prefix ""un"". If these keywords or prefixes are added or removed that could be monitored and also cause a major change notification.

The amount of delay can be a setting someplace", either in the user settings, or server-side config.  Instead of posting right away, enter the post in a queue.  During this window of time, the user can edit  post to  heart\'s content.  Once the delay is finished, actually do the posting.  This way, the fears of the core devs are pretty much allayed (correct me if I\'m wrong on that), and the users get an edit facility. Implementation details are up in the air, and open for discussion.  Say, a timestamp column on the table.  or whatever.  Something to indicate that this post has or has not gone out yet.  So, a not-yet-posted post is visible only to the author, and otherwise appears indistinguishable from a normal post, other than having an Edit button or link. If the delay amount is put in the user settings, then users can choose how much delay they want, so people can choose to have their posts go out straight away, while others can elect to have a window of editability, at the cost of delayed posting.

In order for your proposal to work we would have to have an identifier to link the messages together (which we have, but the use of which might break the sync process), but also a sequence to specify the order of messages in the history.  Both of these would have to be in the protocol and somehow still ensure uniqueness across pods. Then you have the issue of privacy.  Consider the situation where a user is removed from another user\'s aspect between revisions of a message, meaning that the recipient still has access to that message but only before a certain revision.  This means that the pod has to withhold all revisions after the change.  This situation becomes more complex, of course, if the user is subsequently re-added to that aspect, resulting in a period of revisions being withheld.""'

Add to what they said.  etc. It doesn\'t solve anything to just let people edit their posts if it is making the other members responses not make any sense if you are reading it.  Unless the one responding quotes the original post.  Unfortunately not many people know how or use the quote button.  If only they did.

If you think so, then when a bunch of your posts are removed, lets see if it irritates you because I will tell you, it will.  All because someone decides not to leave their post alone and change what they said or meant.  Its the original poster that is the problem, not the people responding to them.

Go to a un-moderated site and see how rude some people can be to each other without any intervention by admins.  See how confusing a thread can get when people keep posting, then editing their post after about 20 people have responded to the post.  If you don\'t understand what I am trying to say.  Set up a board, get nearly 100,000 people posting on it without any rules.  Let them post as they like and see how long it takes you to start to HAVE to implement rules.

This pull request fixes that by making the user menu accessible by allowing it to scroll into view, and it does so while being the least disruptive to any other styling or structure decisions already made for the UI. Just as the UI has more or less matured, I think it would be much more of an undertaking than it\'s worth to fix this bug by doing lots of restructuring. Another option would be to remove the positioning on the and readjust the value any time the window is scrolled vertically. With no positioning, the would be allowed to scroll horizontally with the rest of the page. Yet another option, which removes the use of JavaScript, would be to add a scrolling wrapper element immediately after the element, and then this would be what scrolls instead of the window. A side effect of this would be that the element would no longer have a minimum width imposed by the element.

diaspora,2099,closed,3,2011-10-04 03:09:33,1399.07,,1,,b'b\' Currently for me, StartSSL is a non-starter. Aside from the implications from being hacked (considering SSL is pretty much fundamentally worthless anyway) the site is broken and gives this error each time I attempt to use Firefox to sign up for a cert: Further, it actually crashes Safari when I attempt to use its control  a StartSSL cert in that browser. I realize this is not Diaspora\\\'s problem directly," but it is a huge blocker that will prohibit the average hobbyist who is curious about Diaspora from getting their own pod going and connecting it to others. I asked the _question_ ""what\\\'s the deal?"" here in order to get at some answers which I don\\\'t have. Hence", @maxwell," I am not going to update the wiki unless I have a clear answer to the ""what do I do for an SSL cert?"" question. I have managed to get my own pod up and running", but I am using a self-signed SSL certificate, and while this works for intra-pod activity, I\\\'m not going to be able to do any inter-pod communication from my understanding until I get a trusted cert. While @gladiac commented to include mentions of both StartSSL and CAcert in the wiki, I cannot imagine how that would help anyone since a CAcert is as untrusted as a self-signed cert, and StartSSL to be frank, is a mess. So I guess the summary is: I need these questions answered before I can begin seriously participating:1. Does Diaspora support self-signed certificates?2. Should the project recommend these CAs who issues certs that may not fully work?3. Should the project recommend that those interested in setting up their own pod just buy a cert and if so, **which** specific kind of cert is required? I really want this project to succeed, and I am willing to put forth effort such as editing the wiki, contributing code, and more, but I need a little guidance and understanding before I can do so. :)\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You could make the argument that ""well"," they could be filtered out like the Aspects in the stream""", and while that\\\'s true enough, Friendica does something like that and it\\\'s not really an ideal solution.

We need to either rename that function into something like ""enable facebook cross-posting""", _or_ we can think of some lightweight Facebook stream aggregation functionality. The sole purpose of such hypothetical aggregation functionality would be to free diaspora\\\\* users from the need to check two websites each time. But if they want to _interact_ with the people on Facebook, they would still need to either go to Facebook or to invite their friends to Diaspora*. Integrating Facebook with Diaspora in some deeper way would be against the idea why Diaspora was created: to have an open source, decentralized and privacy-respecting social networking solution (if that\\\'s correct).

Could someone point me to the widget for twitter stream integration? I would like to have similar features as discussed here for facebook for twitter. I would prefer to read my twitter stream and my twitter notifications through diaspora (via filters called #mytwitterstream #mytwitternotifications on the left side). That way, as a user: I exactly know what comes from twitter and what out of the diaspora network. I would also like to decide which diaspora posts should also be published on my twitter account via an aspect called twitter. And an amazing killer-feature would be, if I could decide to reshare and to reply to a message of my twitter stream only in my diaspora network or in both twitter and diaspora. Shall I open a new issue for this on github, a discussion on loomio," are there already some? Could some experienced diaspora developer estimate the effort to implement what I described?

I\'m not a developer, but I\'m fairly sure that (a) there is general agreement that some form of integration of Twitter feeds into Diaspora\'s stream would be an  idea, and that (b) the blocker up to this point to implementing it has been that Diaspora does not yet have a solid API in order to authorise such integration. It is currently possible to cross-post _from_ Diaspora _to_ FB,Twitter, Tumblr and Wordpress, but this uses the APIs of those services. I believe that in order to cross-post _from_ those services _to_ Diaspora, Diaspora needs its own API for authorisation. A draft API for authorisation has been created in  #4554, but there remains work to be done in coding and reviewing before this is ready to be implemented in Diaspora\'s code. Until Diaspora has a workable API, it\'s going to be difficult to have viable integration with Twitter and other services enabling user to see for example their Twitter feed within Diaspora. Of course, it may well be possible to create a separate JS widget (not integrated into Diaspora\'s codebase), to be downloaded by individual users and stored as a user script within their browsers. This could amend the Diaspora page such that it can display a Twitter feed on the same page as Diaspora\'s stream, without actually integrating this feed into Diaspora\'s stream," and could perhaps be based on [Twitter\'s standard widget]url  I hope this is (a) correct and (b) useful.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

diaspora,3009,closed,28,2012-03-14 22:33:23,1148.77,1,,,b'b\' The advantage of allowing people to see their Facebook feed is this: it would go a long way in encouraging people to switch from, and eventually stop using, Facebook. One of the major difficulties of getting people to switch social networks is that they don\\\'t want to lose contact with their friends. Case in point: Google+. While their social network arguably left something to be desired to say the least, they figuratively had more money than God to create it and a vast pool of brilliant young-ish minds to dream it up. Yet still they had to coerce and sometimes, as in the case of YouTube, for example, literally force people to sign up for their service and they still do to this day. People hate change. And while they, myself included, will complain about Facebook to no end," my friends (lower case ""F"") tell me that they would be hard pressed to switch services simply because they are afraid that no one else will. While they are also afraid of learning something new their primary fear is simply of shouting into the ether and not hearing anything in return. Other than that"," I think they have little to fear as far as change is concerned. Diaspora even has a ""Like"" link under peoples\\\' posts. While I personally don\\\'t like the ""Like"" it IS there and should help belay some apprehension when considering the switch from Facebook.\\\\* If they just had their feeds from Facebook they would be happy. I don\\\'t think getting more people to switch would be hard at all if only that feature were available. At any rate"," I came across this thread after signing up for Diaspora. I wanted to be able to fully and properly promote it to my friends and I was searching for the very thing being discussed here so that I can better lure them away from the land of the Facebook. -Cyber *Concerning ""Like"": I know why Facebook will never take away the ""Like"" link or even add a ""Dislike"" option"," for that matter. I think that if they were to add an alternative to ""Like"" the problem would be this: people would use it. As it stands right now", you can post anything you wish and the only purely quantitative feedback you will ever get, aside from the number of comments," is the number of ""Likes"". I have a feeling that if they were to add a ""Dislike"" feature that many would be seriously put off by people simply ""Disliking"" their posts. I don\\\'t know why but there is something about human psychology wherein much significance is placed on things with numbers attached to them much like scoring. Right now you can only get a positive ""score"""," if you get anything at all. I would be willing to wager that if a ""Dislike"" feature were added", Facebooks numbers would be affected in a way not to Mr. Zuckerberg\\\'s liking. Yes," it\\\'s always sunny in Facebook Land... I think a good alternative would be to have some sort of neutral indicator such as ""Viewed"". It could either be automatically registered if it appears on someone elses screen or manually selected by someone if they wished to mark that post. It could be something akin to YouTube with Views", Thumbs . I really have no problem with  or Thumb .

diaspora,3009,closed,31,2012-03-14 22:33:23,1366.73,,,1,b'b\' CybershamanX is absolutely correct here, and I\\\'m a bit concerned that the Diaspora devs don\\\'t seem to realize how important this kind of functionality is in getting people to switch.  It is a DEAL-BREAKER that Facebook content be available to new users, at least as an option, regardless of what privacy issues this might raise.  The number 1 priority for participating in social media is to be connected, and regardless of what fantastic ideals we might be pitching for joining a non-commercial decentralized one that doesn\\\'t spy on you or advertise.... it\\\'s plainly obvious that most people trade all of those things for the connectivity with just a little grumbling.  They go where the people are. Even speaking as someone who really believes 1000% in Diaspora\\\'s purpose and would love to see Facebook burn to the ground, I am STILL reluctant to join because it severs so many of my connections.  I can proselytize to my friends until I\\\'m blue in the face, but they won\\\'t switch for the same reason I hesitated, only they DON\\\'T have a tin-foil hat like mine to motivate them.  For so many people, myself included, just keeping up on Facebook is enough work, I don\\\'t need another news feed to read in a separate platform where nobody I know lives. I\\\'m reminded of the way Apple is slowly unseating the incumbant SMS protocol by providing a completely user-experience-transparent alternative (iMessage) that most people have no idea they\\\'re using.  When iOS devices message each other, they use iMessage, when they message other mobile devices they revert to SMS.  This switch is completely invisible to the user, and it would not have taken hold if it had been otherwise.  Now they\\\'ve amassed such a user base using iMessage that it is practical," even a selling point that Wifi-only devices and Macs can communicate via this protocol.  But if they had approached people 5 years ago and said ""Hey", wanna switch to iMessage? It\\\'s better in every way," but you can\\\'t communicate with anyone who uses SMS""", they would have been roundly rejected, and rightfully so. That\\\'s the kind of connectivity we need.  Regardless of how it might clutter up the Stream or compromise privacy (only for correspondence via the FB protocol yeah?), it is absolutely essential and you will not see Diaspora unseat Facebook without it.  We could even be pushy in clever little ways, like a little reminder at the bottom of FB correspondence that warns of an insecure connection," or some other ""bad network"" ""good network"" highlighting.  Privacy will come gradually instead of a complete detachment from one\\\'s less progress-minded peers.\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve only seen it once for sure, but basically what I saw was that a comment sent by Diaspora was rejected by Friendica based on signature validation problems. The public key that was sent with the comment was off by one character in the middle of the key from the public keys both in Diaspora\'s database and Friendica\'s database. I also need to take some time to understand which public key Diaspora uses to verify the signature. As far as I can tell, there are three possible sources to get the public key from: 1) Diaspora\'s local database, 2) a webfinger request to the remote user, or 3) the public key included in the sent message.

I see the problems in the log file, as either or (essentially)  . The is another problem, separate from the whitespace issue that I\'ve found. @Raven24 I don\'t see any reason to transfer the whitespace verbatim, we just need to remove the whitespace before creating a signature. @maxwell I\'m seeing the problems when not in single process mode. Further, I can reproduce the problem on , which I\'m sure is not in single process mode. The bug appears to be very simple to me. If a user enters whitespace before the text of her comment, then when the comment is created (through  , which calls  , which then calls  , which itself calls  ) the signature is created using the text that has the leading whitespace. But then, when the comment is relayed off to another pod, the leading whitespace is stripped out when the XML is created. Then, when the next pod gets the comment, it checks the signature using the text with the leading whitespace stripped out and the signature fails verification. That causes the comment to disappear. So it seems like the fix is simple: just strip out the leading and trailing whitespace in the comment text before creating the signatures. The only problem I\'m having is that I can\'t get the RSpec test I wrote to fail so that I can submit the fix. I believe that my inability to get the test to fail has more to do with my inexperience with RSpec than the idea that there\'s no problem," because I can consistently reproduce the problem on live pods.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The latter function saves the comment to the database, and a is done on the text before saving to the database. By using the function, the test was never stripping the text, so the verification upon receiving the XML didn\'t fail. Second, even if was changed to  , the test would still not work, because after the signatures were created by either or  , I was then re-assigning explicitly," which then used the stripped text.

The formatting problem is Friendica\'s problem. I don\'t think it\'s too hard to fix," it just involves making some changes to the function in the file  .

Also, as @jancborchardt brought up, the cancel button can always be pressed by mistake, regardless how much it differs visually.

Also the user who writes the post won\\\'t be able to add the user to the aspect while writing the post (only if the user uses a second browser window and then the containing contacts may be cached by the first window...).Okay"," one last idea: You could show the warning and have a checkbox for ""add the user to the targer aspect when submitting"".

(You don\'t need the escape characters, I don\'t think.) As MrZyX says, this would mean no OG preview in Diaspora for PicUp images, but actually they are not really needed because the preview would just be the same image plus a bit of text about PicUp, and your link in the form above wraps the image in a link to the containing page on PicUp.

As of March 28 Facebook has rolled out Facebook API V2.3 (Bit earlier but the rules apply from 28th) they have applied several **NEW** rules. There is a **requirement** of having a **JavaScript SDK** which is connected straight to **Facebook** their tracking system. This includes having a **\\\'Signup with Facebook!\\\'** on the landing page and a bonus of privacy stab in the back you have to install **Facebook JavaScript SDK** which has the ability to track the activity on your pod. As a joke on 1st of April of team@ at \\\'post guid\\\' **** came quite close to what the features of the **JavaScript SDK** offers (feel the irony?). **Every thing in a list:**You are required to have a **Sign up with Facebook** button on the landing page,Install **JavaScript SDK** from Facebook,"Agree with their ""Privacy Policy""",Allow them to track your users and your self on Facebook. This info came from an old friend that continuously makes money with Facebook apps. And he has recently informed a lawyer for an explanation which I got confirmed trough phone. Because of the reason I kind of felt stabbed in the back (last time and I am still feeling it) you have to verify it your own at url  / Well known privacy policy.

I was thinking we could add a third setting to the Facebook services setting in called with options  ", or a _username_. False would mean it the buttons is not visible of course, would mean the podmin has checked the FB app permissions ( ) and thus guarantees the service works for all users. As a third option, a username can be provided, who the button would show for. This is expected to be the user who has created the FB app, since this user can _always_ post, as has been tried. This would allow podmins to set themselves cross-posting without having to worry about allowing non-working service linking to other users on their pod. I can gladly do the change, if no one opposes. This would mean all podmins would need to check their current FB app when the change is deployed and set the correct value.

If, on the other hand, the podmin has made any changes to this field in , this customised text in  will be used rather than any i18n locales. That way messages could be sent in users\' preferred languages _if_ the default text has remained unchanged, but if the podmin has customised the text," it will be sent to each user in the language set by the podmin. A note that the welcome message will not be localised if the podmin changes the text could be added to the explanation of this feature in .""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

diaspora,6095,closed,9,2015-06-12 21:29:08,5.22,,,1,b'b\' Thank you very much for insulting us. I guess you are aware we had this discussion before, but I will explain it to you once again so you have another chance to understand it. First of all, nobody is forcing you to contribute to this open source project. You do this on your own will and I appreciate the amount of time you put into collaborating. However, as soon as you are asking for any kind of support or endorsement from an open source project, you will have to collaborate with the projects team. @jaywink got push access by a Loomio vote, @jhass and myself got added by the core team because they valued our contributions. So at any given point, you have to understand that, in doubt, we are the ones doing decisions. This has nothing to do with dictatorship, but with plain project management. And you do have to deal with our feedback if you want to get your work merged into the projects core. You submitted a pull request here. If someone opens a pull request in this project, I get both an email and a desktop notification that somebody wants their code merged or is looking for feedback. Usually, one of the project members will have a look at it within hours. I got your pull request and immediately realized that this is neither a working contribution nor code you have written yourself. While the first one is okay since this PR is clearly marked as a work in progress, the second issue is something I simply can not and will not accept. Given the fact I occasionally do get paid for open source work and I am in fact one of the elected owners of the diaspora projects, I assume I do know the open source world quite a bit. You pulled sources made by other people without giving them any credit. That is unacceptable for multiple reasons: First, you do in fact violate copyright law here. If GitHub gets a complaint, they will check the issue and either delete your repository or even your account. As a project with over 10.000 stars, we have to make sure we do not run into any troubles. Secondly, the person writing this code also spent a lot of time in writing it and I can safely assume the codes authors put more time into it than you did with pulling it. What you did is ethically wrong and I do not care if this is a work in progress or not. Last but not least, you are forcing everyone forking your fork to contribute to the stuff you have done to make exactly the same mistakes you did and that is nothing I want to be responsible for. I am aware (because you made that clear multiple times) that you are not a good ruby developer and that is totally fine. But since you are aware of that, I really wonder why you pick the most complicating task that is available. OpenID Connect and OAuth are complex protocols, but they are easy to understand for someone who has some experience and maybe you should think about talking to people before you start randomly pulling code and submitting pull requests. You now claimed that you just did this as a starting point for others. While the idea is good, using code that you did not understand, code that does not match our guides, code that is not even legal to use at this point as a starting point for one of the largest tasks we will ever have is, if you pardon me saying so, insane. If you really want to help, go ahead and create a plan on what has to be done and when it has to be done and do not try to add code as a foundation which will simply not get the job done at this point. Also," let me make something else clear. If you start something as a ""manager"" as you are apparently about to do", you have to finish it. I am aware you are not able to handle feedback and you start insulting others and get huffy. We had this at your first Bootstrap pull request where you simply refused to continue working since you thought our points were invalid without being able to argue against them. We had a similar situation at your second Bootstrap pull request where you  unable to finish it and we had to pull the PR out for adoption and depend one other contributors to fix it. And since you already start acting like that, I am certain we will reach this point again. Please think about you want to do before you start doing it. Everything else is just a waste of your and our time.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,

Hence", it\'s better than just me, working on my own. This work has many unclear points to me. Some things I\'m still unsure how to handle. I know where to go. But I still don\'t completely know how. Keep in mind that I didn\'t know anything about Ruby or Rails 6 months ago. So, I will likely do innefficient or even bad things. So, I prefer make them publicly so I can have a quick feedback and a piece of advice. It\'s really not just some random work thrown in the lion cage. It\'s a hard work and it\'s going to take me time because OAuth and OIDC are no easy protocols to understand, I know very few about Rails an I\'m still learning Ruby and the gem is completely undocumented. This is why I can\'t just plan a roadmap. @jaywink : Ok, I apologize, then. But no, as I said, this is not just random work. I keep working on this really hard and most of the code is going to change. The reason I opened the PR is that I\'m studying how to handle the tokens for each user. The orginal implementation from Nov inserted them into database but I\'m concerned this would flood it with useless outdated token and the DB would have to be flushed regularly. This, and other concerns about encryption. E.g, I think I have understood each d\\\\* user have his own encryption key ? @jhass is right. I probably should have written this in the first post. I didn\'t because I lacked time. @denschub : Maybe this is not the best place to disuss our personal feelings. I didn\'t and I hadn\'t in mind insulting you or anyone else. I didn\'t found your remark on the copyright thing relevant because I already know this code is going to change. But, I **did not** as you said just pulled the project and randomly add files. I first experiment that code on a sperate project and I did realise that I couldn\'t go further because it needed integration with diaspora code. I need to integrate this into the diapora user model. And I wanted to do this openly and publicly. But let me assure you that, even this is complicated, I always finish my work. Now," the last question is: what shall I do?

I\\\'ve only implemented the user credential flow to provide tokens but the goal is to provide the 4 different flows."" From what I read", there is no password flow in OIDC, that is an OAuth2 only concept. I assume this is because it defeats the purpose of OIDC to provide the client application (RP) with your password. All three of the OIDC flows (auth code, implicit, hybrid) rely on having the user authenticate with the OP (e.g., Diaspora pod) and then the OP passes the access tokens to the RP (e.g.," a native mobile application). ""Then", the tokens can be used to do anything the API let the application do. In a short term," let\\\'s stick with OIDC and say the API is limited to provide identity informations (the famous ""connect with "" on the websites)."" Yeah this sounds like a good plan. Basically the only point I want to make is that I would like to add a redirect to our initial plans.1. Client should click the ""Connect with Diaspora"" button on the native app2. Client is redirected to a Diaspora pod3. Client logins to a Diaspora pod and authorizes the native app (note how the native app will never get the user\\\'s Diaspora pod password)4. Client is redirected back to the native app with the access token (we can skip the ID token for now)5. Client should be able to get identity information from the user-info endpoint using the access token Edit: Ok after going through Nov\\\'s application again", I realized that the password flow is a convinient way to test that the user-info endpoint works (aka the part where we use the access token to obtain the user\\\'s identity). I just want to make sure we are on the same page in that we will be using the password flow just to test our user-info endpoint and our goal isn\\\'t to provide 4 different flows defined by the OAuth2 RFC 6749 specification but instead to provide the 3 different flows defined by OIDC. The auth code and the implicit flows that are defined by both OAuth2 and OIDC are similar but OAuth2 is a bit more vague. OAuth2 RFC 6749, 1.2. Protocol Flow," states that in the first step  ""The client requests authorization from the resource owner. The authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner (as shown)"," or preferably indirectly via the authorization server as an intermediary."" Instead of ""preferably indirectly via the authorization server as an intermediary"," I want to make sure that we are planning to definitely authorize via the authorization server as specified by the OIDC spec. So in terms of where we are headed next, I suggest we implement Nov\\\'s UserInfoController equivalent, especially the part. Once we can successfully obtain the user\\\'s identity through cUrl, we should move on to implement OIDC\\\'s implicit flow as I outlined before this edit. For this we will need an actual client app just like Nov\\\'s RP sample unless we can somehow handle redirects with cUrl. Once we finish OIDC\\\'s implicit flow, we should then drop support for the password flow as we no longer need it. Either way, we should then move on to implement the other 2 OIDC flows.

Essentially instead of returning I should return right?I take supporting none in id_token_signing_alg_values_supported is optional? Yup as far as I read it isn\\\'t listed on the list of mandatory features that need to be implemented for the core or dynamic.Does the spec say anything about returning non-ASCII data?  As we discussed on IRC, we need to set the charset.What\\\'s up with this? Inconsistent claims about scopes supported?  It is saying that we have not supported the \\\'profile\\\' scope and we don\\\'t plan to. I don\\\'t see any issue here.display=popup is ignored and done like display=page? So yeah, ideally a popup would be shown but I interpret that display=page suffices for now.prompt=none displays the authorize page anyhow?prompt=none while signed out gives me the login page Yeah it returns an error if the user isn\\\'t already logged in. I suppose the issue is that the login page shouldn\\\'t be shown before the error is shown? If so, would I have to remove  . How would I force authentication inside a controller method? Is there anyway to do something like (pseudo-code below):  Is properly implementing the user hint on the todo list?Is properly supporting ui_locales on the todo list? They aren\\\'t but they are now :+1: policy_uri is ignored.tos_uri is ignored. Yeah we have to show these in the authorization page. @AugierLe42e you want to add these in the front-end or should I handle this?So we have to implement key rotation, at least at some point? Not mandatory for the core or for dynamic, but on the TODO list.Could you please elaborate again on why implementing the ""request_uri Request Parameter"" section is not required for a compliant implementation? It is mandatory (at least unsigned request_uri\\\'s) for dynamic. I just thought we could leave it out of this PR. The rationale for having these request_uri\\\'s seem to be as follows: url  I won\\\'t argue if you think this should be included in this PR.\''

Where possible the RP should get the error, OIDC obviously has a mechanism for that, what you\'ve shown would be a possible realization of such a mechanism and iirc it\'s done similarly in oAuth2. For cases where the RP can\'t or shouldn\'t be informed, we should display a nice error page.A link to the spec that states it as optional would be very reassuring ;)I would expect so, just registers a method to be called, it does not invoke things in a special callback registry.

Currently, for a recent post I made," I had **89 failures** for outgoing sidekiq jobs. I can only imagine how much extra weight this is putting on large long running pods. So what I would propose is to either;Add a ""retry_next"" timestamp which would be set on a failure. It would start as ""1s"" and increase exponentally each time a failure occurs.

Here is what I found:When previewing, clicking on the timeago link will crash the app with  . I don\\\'t know if it\\\'s because I\\\'m in dev mode that I don\\\'t have a classic 404 or if there is a bug somehow. I feel anyway that there is something weird here. We should probably disable those link (timeago, like, comment, delete with the trash icon...) Now that the rendering is done inside the publisher, I\\\'m even wondering if we should not render this part (avatar, top & bottom) at all, showing only the actual content, what\\\'s entered inside the publisher. Maybe with a background color so the user immediately knows he is in the preview tab: **Actual**![actual]url **Expected**![expected]url  What does everybody think about that?I also noticed that the poll button is broken," nothing happens when clicking in it. As the build passed on Travis for Ruby 2.2 I guess that means we are missing tests here ;)The ordered list only insert ""1."" in front of each line. This works and is correctly rendered by the markdown engine (1.", 2., 3., ...) but it looks weird from a user point of view. I guess this is internal to bootstrap-markdown though and we can live with it.Some allowed syntax by diaspora\\\\* are missing like horizontal line, crossed text, table... Those can be added in following PR I guess, it\\\'s not a merge blocker. All other feature seems to work, nice job! I\\\'m really excited about this feature.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

diaspora,6655,closed,5,2016-01-24 19:46:28,76.63,1,,,"b'b"" @abimelex", @jhass  In diaspora both like and comment are Relayable objects and the actions of unliking a public post or deleting a comment are delegated to the  instance method. While the  method is in charge, it does the following:Builds RelayableRetraction object.Builds Postzord::Dispatcher object, that returns an instance of Postzord::Dispatcher::Private then send the [post] message to this instance.The post method of Postzord::Dispatcher::Private executes post_to_subscribers on self which in turns executes deliver_to_local on self deliver_to_local starts a sidekiq worker then Workers:: is invoked The perform method of  Workers::Receive instance invokes suppress_annoying_errors (which is inherited from Workers::Base to catch raised exception) with a block that instantiate an instance of Postzord::Receiver::Private then invokes parse_and_receive method on this instanceFinally the parse_and_receive methods invokes validate_object method on self which raises Diaspora::ContactRequiredUnlessRequest exception and prevent the retraction of the RelayableRetraction object. In our example of unliking a public post or deleting a comment on it, the method contact_required_unless_request in Postzord::Receiver::Private class ensures that the post\'s owner has the author in his contact otherwise Diaspora::ContactRequiredUnlessRequest is rasied. The current implementation of this method: A possible fix is to check if the RelayableRetraction object\'s parent is public and if it is return false from contact_required_unless_request which means that contact is not required, a suggested implementation look like this: Thanks,"Sayed""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Pasting  /  outputs is only creating noise. Without detailed information about the memory contents and the full environment, these numbers are totally useless and make this issue look like everyone is whining.No, there is no **leak**. A memory leak is indicated by a constantly growing memory usage without any limit. We\\\'ve had one in the past by reusing cURL sockets (technically that was not even a leak either since it eventually could have reached its limit, but the numbers are way to high on this), which got fixed. Even for @jaywink, memory consumption seems to be stable now. Nobody in the active development team was able to find an leak, so unless you can prove that there are leaks, there are none.Yes, Sidekiq eats quite a lot of memory. However, compared to, for example GitLab, our memory consumption is quote low if you match up the concurrency settings.If you want to reduce your memory footprint, reduce Sidekiqs concurrency and reduce the size of the database connection pool. If you actually want to contribute to this issue in any way:Figure out if we even need more than, let\\\'s say, 2 sidekiq threads. Our new federation tasks are really fast compared to the old ones and we might not even run into queuing problems with smaller numbers. 5/25 were picked ages ago, with basically everything inside diaspora* looking different. One could, for example, draw charts with average job wait times. If workers are idle most of the time, we could try decreasing the concurrency to increase the worker worktime while keeping the peak job time below 5 minutes, for example.If you feel adventurous," see url  from July. There\\\'s an explicit warning and _""But if enough people experiment with this", we eventually we might gather enough experience in the community to be able to recommend settings for small," medium and large setups.""_", which is still true.Understand how the GC in Ruby really works. Maybe, we\\\'re doing something incredibly stupid and the fix is very simple.Understand how memory profiling in Ruby cleanly works and dig further into the memory traces. We know that a lot of memory is allocated inside ActiveRecord bindings, but this information is totally worthless without knowing what\\\'s inside those bindings. Also, figure out on how we can make this more efficient. Don\\\'t ask here, we don\\\'t have an idea. However, please write a blog post or something about this since I would be really interested in learning that. If you feel like everything sucks, feel free to:Submit Pull Requests to Sidekiq to help them improve their memory footprint.Investigate alternative Queuing solutions. Compare and benchmark them. Port diaspora*.Rewrite our workers using, for example, goworker. Also, figure out how to build and deploy them for all podmins without having them setting up an entire Go build stack.Build our very own and tailored solution for background processing, with performance and a low footprint in mind. Also, figure out how to build and deploy them for all podmins without having them setting up an entire  build stack. In any case," **stop using this issue for ""I am having memory bloat as well"" posts**. I will delete all of them that ever appear below this comment. Our GitHub issue tracker is not a support platform", and I don\\\'t want to discuss configuration issues here at all. If we figure out our default settings are bad (which very well may be), we should change them. If we figure out we can give podmins a better idea of what they should set their concurrency to, we should add that stuff to the wiki. The only things that belong into this issue, if anything, are discussions regarding memory improvements we could perform on our side.\''

Triggering a new query to the server each time the user wants to mention someone has at least two flaws:1. the mentionning system is going to get much slower than before #6951 and probably _really_ slow on pods with high traffics (JD, d-fr or Framasphere),2. the mentionning system will fail if the server or client temporarily goes offline while the user is typing a message. Allowing the mentionning system to fail even if the page is fully loaded is a bad UX, IMHO, and I really don\'t think the gain is worth it. The search bar and the mentionning dropdown should, at the very least, be fed with the contacts the user is sharing with (the mentionning dropdown actually doesn\'t need more).

By the way\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 if I understand you two right," this **should** work (but it doesn\'t)  url the format now is clear by the .json so\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 shouldn\'t the rest be taken as guid?""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, I think it\'s fixable (everything is fixable with more or less effort), but I didn\'t know how easy it is, or if we need to write a big and ugly workaround for that to work. Also it isn\'t a problem of the language, it\'s a problem of the framework. But of course you can write another framework with the same language without this behavior and you wouldn\'t have the problem, but I think that\'s not an option here ;) That doesn\'t work, browsers replace them back to and it doesn\'t work anymore (which would end in weird bugreports when it sometimes work but not always).

And I think that linking to a profile from a bio is a valid use-case and using something that already exists and users already know maybe isn\'t that bad? We don\'t need the notifications, but otherwise a mention would work perfectly. And it would also have advantages for the protocol, because that way every text with Markdown would support the same .  An alternative would be to do something with  -URLs but that would be something special again (currently we don\'t support linking to profiles that way, and also don\'t support of fetching profiles with it).  Since I think that\'s a valid feature-request and we don\'t provide a proper solution for this yet," I\'m reopening this.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
