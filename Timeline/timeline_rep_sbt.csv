sbt,18,closed,5,2011-05-15 20:26:35,148.72,,,1,"b'b"" The problem is that source file hashes are insufficient.  It is possible for a class file from the same source file to be different due to binary or source dependencies changing.  Source tracks this information.  Now", you could hash all class files that came from the source.  I think that will work.  I don\'t know how expensive that will be, though. As for why it checks the api in other projects, consider projects A and B, with B depending on A.  B needs to know the Source for A when B was last compiled, not when A was last compiled.  It isn\'t important whether the source files for A have changed or not.  What is important is whether the Source has changed since the last time B was compiled.  Make sense? If you are sure the API comparison is a bottleneck, we can probably generate a unique ID for each API when it\'s created and use that to shortcut things for the common case where the API hasn\'t changed at all.  If you want to look at doing this, let me know.  Otherwise, I\'ll do it.  Either way," thanks for the work you have done so far on this.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sbt,35,closed,body,2011-06-05 03:49:25,00:00,1,,,b'b\' I\\\'m finding some strange behavior with the new external multiproject support. I have two projects," A and B which both dependOn external project C using RootProject(""../c""). If I go to project A and compile it", C is also compiled, and all is well. However, if I then go to project B and compile it, _this also causes C to be entirely recompiled._ This of course is awful, because C takes a couple of minutes to compile and this happens whenever I switch between A and B.

The cause of the problem is that by default, sbt uses the  directory in the project you start sbt in and in particular, the Scala files there.  So, when you move between projects, sbt sees a different version of scalafor c (the one in  and then in ) and thinks the source needs recompiling. There are two solutions I can think of.  First," you can have a global boot directory that is shared by all projects on your machine.  You can do this by setting the system property in your launcher script.  It can also be passed directly to the sbt script to just try it out at first.  For example: The other option is to have another project that refers to the three projects and then always run sbt on that project.  This other project doesn\'t have to contain the subdirectories.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, the classpath passed to Scala is not in this loaderit is in a child class loader that Scala creates.  So, how would  find that class loader?  I\'m guessing it doesn\'t and that\'s why you see this problem. The best confirmation I found on this is actually from [API docs]url  from a logging wrapper by @bmc.

Let\\\'s Document what it does, and figure out how to evolve if.  IF we want to change semanticcs, probably the best thing to do is hit the simple-build-tool list with the proposed change and see if people complain, because the fact is we _don\\\'t know_ who may be affected right now, so you can\\\'t make any assumptions. Even so, I\\\'m not a fan of this level of change without a deprecation period for the previous behavior (and additional documentation). Let\\\'s follow some boy-scout rule here.

Something you do normally results in your instable ivy cache, some kind of workflow that is different from most of our users. What could help is to track the difference between when your cache is ok vs. when it is not ok.  That would at least help us isolate the symptom which leads to poor behavior.

sbt,1091,closed,15,2014-01-18 23:33:52,24.25,1,,,b'b\' It\\\'s quite hard to refine what the issue is if the environment is not stable, and also quite hard to reproduce. A few notes:1. Ivy is the one doing the downloading. Sbt has bent over backwards to try to ensure this only happens when necessary, some of which involves making Ivy pretend that artifacts downloaded from different URLs may be the same thing.2. The launcher is responsible for downloading portions of the cache, and sbt\\\'s ivy library the rest.  There may exist subtle differences here, especially across sbt boundaries.  0.13 involved a change whereby scala is pulled using Ivy, rather than the launcher.  This was done so that it _would_ redownload -SNAPSHOT when there was a new -SNAPSHOT available.  I have no idea what happens if you cross between 0.12 + 0.13 at this point, albeit to say that I do this all the time and I haven\\\'t experienced the issue.  I _do_ stick to the same launcher version.3. -SNAPSHOT is _already_ a bit of a foreign concept to Ivy," so its behavior has been less than ideal.  My guess is that somehow the file you\\\'re downloading the and ""timestamp"" in the ivy cache are consistently out of date when your cache goes sour. If you can provide a reproducible test case", we can try to figure this out.  Also noting the version of sbt you\\\'re using is helpful.

Incremental compiler detects changes to APIs (and triggers recompilation) based on  signatures as viewed at pickling phase. Pickling phase represents signatures before erasure. That means", if you have: and you change to be a value class the signature of method won\'t change. It will be still  . However, the erasure of is very different if is a value class (it erases to whatever value class wraps). Given the fact that incremental compiler looks only at pre-erasure types, it has no why of noticing the difference. The most principled solution would be to index all signatures twice:at pickling phaseafter erasure (or posterasure, so value classes are completely erased) We would have to introduce a whole new tree walk that indexes all the types. However, that would be very expensive to do especially given the fact that #1078 is not fixed yet. The alternative would be to introduce a special case for value classes and index references to them separately. Specifically, when indexing TypeRefs," we would capture the fact whether a class is a value class.

sbt,1223,closed,body,2014-03-29 18:57:22,00:00,1,,,b'b\' I tracked down a PermGen leak in sbt, which can easily be worked around (although other PermGen leaks may exist). The full story is below, but in short object finalizers are not called frequently enough by the VM (in jdk 6 and 7), causing classloaders to survive long past their time. The solution is adding after the parts of runTask that create a new classloader, in order to launch Scala or other utilities, the sequence: That must be done from an enclosing stack frame that no longer contains any reference, direct or indirect, to the generated classloader (note that escape analysis was not generally on by default in jdk 6). The complete, albeit condensed explanation, is:Each time sbt invokes the Scala compiler, by creating a new classloader, the classloader is not released.the classloader is kept in the heap by means of a chain of links involving weak references. In particular, when the garbage collector runs and frees the referent from a weak reference, the referred instance may still being tracked if some finalization is still pending.if finalization is not run promptly, the classloader cannot be freed, and its permgen cannot be released.file descriptors, like FileInputStream or JarFile, are all finalizable, and sbt uses a lot of them.the jdk 6 and 7 are quite lazy when running finalizers. If there is still heap space, they will not rush to complete finalization in order to free memory. The VMs will not notice that PermGen is slowly running out.as a net result, I saw cases in which there are more than 47\\\'000 file descriptors lying idle in the system, indirectly keeping classloaders from being reclaimed, and leading some code to crash despite being given 1GB of PermGen.adding an explicit invocation to runFinalization(), following the exact sequence described above, will solve the problem. The first gc() causes the referent of the WeakReferences to be released, and tracks the newly freed finalizable objects. The runFinalization() call forces the jvm to deal with those instances immediately. Finally, the second gc() will deallocate them. Once the file descriptors are freed, the weak references are also freed, the classloader is freed, and therefore its PermGen space is in the end also freed. More in general,  when using together weak references, multiple classloaders, and files (even if you close them), manual invocations to runFinalization() will be needed," or you will get leaks that may show up as ""Too many files"" or ""PermGen Error"".  Java 8 replaces the PermGen with a ""Meta"" space", but it is still subject to leaks. However, it calls finalizers more promptly, which avoids this issue. Java 6 and Java 7 are both affected.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,

JVM tools like sbt / Ivy let user _over-specify_ the module dependency to a version number (due to culture or lack of good index?). Strict interpretation of the dependency quickly fails, so the tools implemented lenient (automatic) _conflict resolution_ algorithms. Using Ivy, we interpret to be an advisory that you want version  . This is now _under-specification_ because this would admit backward incompatible modules. Eviction warning url  is my attempt at swinging the pendulum back to more stricter side.  More complete solution might be: Allow modules to declare version semantics. Easier version range notation like that used by npm such as and url  Dependency manager that is able to resolve version ranges efficiently. Fail resolution when the constraints are not satisfied," and let the user override them.  Interestingly the users of the tools that uses the above range-and-strict combo seem to be asking for lenient resolution anyway (e.g. url  so the grass might always look greener on the other side.

sbt,2699,closed,26,2016-08-17 03:46:27,92.12,1,,,b'b\'  @eed3si9n  Yes, please, this is utterly important. We can add this information to a module ID.  I think this is a bad idea. We should be using ordinary semantic versioning. JS and other programming languages need that solution because the community does not respect semantic versioning. Allowing this notation will complicate the current situation, not make it easier, and it\\\'s not necessary once you specify the semantic versioning that a module uses. We don\\\'t need more ways to express dependencies.  Dependency lock file will help here.  @clhodapp I don\\\'t like your proposed message, it\\\'s utterly verbose. People that don\\\'t know about semantic versioning and dependency conflicts should look it up. Also, this:  is not accurate. There is no way you can have two versions of the same library in the same classpath. The problem comes when a library depends on another library whose version has been changed, and whose JVM classes have suffered binary changes (therefore changing their ids and causing all sort of linkage issues).  Remember that, currently, this message is shown every time there is an eviction between minor bumps of a given version," *even though it may be safe*. The issue is that the whole Scala community is divided between two different versioning schemes: the one from Java (the normal semantic versioning) and the ""Scala"" one ( ). Sbt assumes the latter one (which we should change). I know that @sjrd has had several issues in the ScalaJS ecosystem because ScalaJS has not ever broken binary compatibility in 0.x.x series.  The major problem when it comes to evicted warnings is that there\\\'s not a general way to reason about version numbers for Scala modules. We should try to change that", and stick with only one way of versioning artifacts. I will open a thread in Scala Contributors about this. \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sbt,2699,closed,27,2016-08-17 03:46:27,23.93,1,,,"b'b\' @eed3si9n There are always going to be constituencies for everything from ""it should resolve everything magically"" to ""any conflict should be an error."" What everyone can agree on is that if it threatens not to work", the reason should be made clear. This is addressable in a general way, so I\\\'d say it makes sense to focus on that.  Given the soft semantics of artifact versioning and the absence of any direct analysis of the true differences between versions, the rest is at best solvable by letting people choose their preferred poison. I think it would be a disaster to introduce version ranges. As observed by @jvican, the core issue is that versions don\\\'t have any consistent meaning. The meaningfulness of a version range is not the sum of the versions it contains it\\\'s the minimum, or worse.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sbt,2699,closed,28,2016-08-17 03:46:27,970.95,,,1,b'b\' @jvican  I disagree with the bulk of your last comment, partially on factual grounds and partially just based on opinion.  First, the factual stuff: This isn\\\'t true: @chris-martin I were pasting examples of what might be shown for a theoretical task or command, which would replace (to be less jargon-y). This is absolutely untrue. The classpath is just list of places for the system classloader to look for classfiles," including directories and jar files. The default system classloader has absolutely no notion of whether two jars constitute ""two versions of the same library"" or not. It just goes down the list", searching each location until it finds (a version of) the desired class. Side-note: If you know exactly what order things will be in on the classpath, it is actually _not_ non-deterministic to have two versions of the same library present. It\\\'s just that it\\\'s generally not  particularly _useful_  (one will generally mostly shadow the other and render most unshadowed classes unlinkable). Also, sbt does not make knowable classpath ordering a goal. Therefore," it is both useless and non-deterministic in practice to allow multiple versions of the same library onto the classpath _when using sbt_.  Now the more opinion-oriented stuff. I feel that this is basically saying ""If users are not already familiar with this other world-theory"," they are inadequate. Seeing this warning (which makes no reference to the world-theory in question) should prompt them to learn all about it and solve their inadequacy"". I think that\\\'s counter-productive. I believe that people who use a tool for a while should be naturally pushed toward actually understanding the potentially-dangerous tradeoffs that the tool is making for them and that the tool should do its best to help them gain that understanding. At the very least", I believe that this information should be available under e.g.  , and that the user should be directed to run that comand for more info when they view the conflict report. While I agree that version ranges are a bad idea, I don\\\'t think that trying to get the entire community to shift to semantic versioning (and assuming that they just  _have_ after some cutover date in the future) is a very good solution. Instead," what if we added some sort of MiMa-verified ""binary compatibility manifest"" to the set of files that may be produced when an artifact was published? The details would have to be worked out", but sbt could pull down one or more compatibility manifests during the dependency resolution process and use them to decide what warnings / errors to display to the user? This way we wouldn\\\'t have to enforce any particular versioning scheme on everybody, the community could gradually transition to a more robust system, and binary compatibility breaks would be much more manageable for well-behaved projects. (I actually have other ideas for less-well-behaved projects, like the ecosystem around Finagle, but I\\\'ll save those for another context, as implementing them wouldn\\\'t really affect sbt).\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Have a look at the implementation url   What you describe is what happens when there is only one user of the library and yes, there is shadowing among jar entries. I misrepresented what I wanted to say.  Let\'s start again: You have two options: 1. Different jars of the same library are binary compatible. 2. Different jars of the same library are binary incompatible.  In the first one, there is no issue, shadowing of jar entries will make sure the first jar entry has always more priority than the second jar entry.  In the second one, though, there is a big issue. If there are more than two users of one library, there will be a clash. Imagine user 1 links from jar 1.2.0 and that will link all its transitive dependencies from its constant pool. Now, user 2 links  (which is defined in 2.0.0) and depends on a binary incompatible  . When the JVM tries to load in the same namespace as the previous  , it will fail.  I don\'t think this behaviour is undefined. If you\'re gonna tell the users that message above, why don\'t tell them the full story?  I\'m all in for changing the message as you can see from my previous message. But I disagree with you on which message to show. Let me explain why.  There are different levels of knowledge, if a kid wants to learn how to solve an equation, he better understands algebra first. Educating is good. But only in the right scenario. Your comprehensive message should be shown per users\' request: by typing  , for instance. But it should not be shown every time I do and sbt resolves dependencies, because a significant percentage of the users hacking on Scala are familiar with the inner workings of the JVM.  I think this is a great idea, but it has the same problem as semantic versioning: adoption. If you\'re gonna take the time to create such a solution, why not bother enforcing a simpler policy such as semantic versioning?  I have a proposal together with @sjrd to make a semantic version scheme for Scala that covers both binary and source compatibility. I\'ll make it public soon in [Scala Contributors](-).  However, your proposal has two more weaknesses:  * MiMa is far from perfect and there are binary changes that won\'t be caught. Versioning jars is something that requires human intelligence (for now) and cannot be automated. I think that semantic versioning is a good way to reason about binary incompatible changes. In fact, it only describes that. People that want to express more than that in a version number are doing it wrong. * You cannot know whether two jars are binary incompatible from the version number. This is bad to diagnose dependency problems.  All this wouldn\'t happen if we agree on some standards, and we enforce them across the Scala community. Those standards would be accompanied by the use of MiMa and human API design, and would result in a semantic version scheme to rule them all.  In any case, as this is still a pipe dream and I\'m sure not all projects will be on board, we better allow what Eugene said: let every module define how its version number should be interpreted for eviction.  Finally, my last comment: all this happens because people don\'t take binary and source compatibility seriously. That has to change. Otherwise," we\'ll continue in the same situation forever.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sbt,2699,closed,33,2016-08-17 03:46:27,1274.0,,,1,"b'b\' @paulp What I meant is that we cannot unconditionally rely on MiMa to version jars. There has to be ""human reasoning"" about every change to the codebase", assumption that brings me to favor semantic versioning as I propose it in my last comment. I like to use MiMa to double-check the implications of some changes, rather than to decide whether I should bump a major or a minor number of a jar revision.  There have recently been several  negatives in MiMa (less than half a year ago):   1. url  1. url  1. url  1. url   These bugs tell me to be careful when using MiMa, since I take bincompat seriously and cannot prove the absence of more of them. These are (normal) misbehaviours of a complex tool trying to solve a challenging task, so I don\\\'t think MiMa is to blame. In fact, I\\\'m surprised there are so few bugs for the inherent level of complexity MiMa is coping with. I think it\\\'s an *excellent* tool -I agree with your statement.  To sum up, my only point is that: is not enough.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sbt,2776,closed,2,2016-10-11 03:50:01,83.57,,1,,b'b\' I\\\'m not sure that it can work with aliases. So before, cross building was dumb, it changed the scala version build wide," even if some sub projects didn\\\'t support that scala version. Then it would issue the ""thing"" that the user requested", be it a command, task or alias, build wide.  If some sub projects didn\\\'t support that scala version (eg, because they were an sbt plugin and so could only build against Scala 2.10), then everything would blow up. So now, when you tell it to cross build, for each scala version, it will gather all the sub projects that can be built against that scala version (based on their own crossScalaVersion setting), set the scala version for those projects, and then issue the specified task against each of those projects.  That\\\'s the change that\\\'s causing this, the thing the user requests has to be a task, it can\\\'t be a command or an alias (which I\\\'m guessing is just a dynamically configured command, I haven\\\'t actually looked at how aliases are configured), since commands and aliases don\\\'t get scoped to projects. My thoughts on this cross building commands or aliases is not something we want to support since the definition of what cross building is now doesn\\\'t make sense in that context.  So I\\\'d say it\\\'s not a bug or a regression, but rather a by design change in behaviour that was necessary to make cross building intelligent, rather than a hack.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sbt,3100,closed,body,2017-04-13 08:11:58,00:00,,,1,"b'b"" I have a corporate artifact repository that proxies external repositories. According to our corporate policy", we are not supposed to pull artifacts straight from public repos, although they have provided some leeway and allow us to go outside, even if we aren\'t supposed to. However, I know they are going to clamp down pretty soon. So, I am trying to figure out how to use proxy repository and disable public repos  I have setup the resolvers in  and  to point to my corporate repo. All the dependencies in  are pulled fine. The problem is that plugins are always pulled from public repo first before sbt goes to my proxy  ## steps To reproduce this problem, I have created a small hello world program with a plugin enabled. Also, when I run this, I have configured my machine so it doesn\'t go out onto the internet. This allows me to check which repo the set is pulling the plugin from  * The source code      \\xe2\\x9e\\x9c  sbt run   This is expected. It\'s going out to type safe repo  * Fixin to go to my repo I changed  to And I get Huh?! Why isn\'t it going to my nexus. If I wait long enough it does fail over to my-nexus. However, it spends a huge time trying to pull every file from type safe. A 20 minute build would probably take close to 6 hours. Note that the same thing happens if I change my ~/ file to point my-ivy-proxy-releases to my-nexus.  * Weird workaround that I figured out SO, after debugging through sbt all night, I figured that this works. I changed  to  Now, I get  Aha! Now it goes to my corporate repo  ## problem  The problem is that when I add to the project, then the control goes to this bit of code in   It seems that whenever an autoPlugin is activated, sbtPlugin is forced to be true. This triggers this bit of code in   isPlugin is true. So," it prepends the sbtResolver and sbtPluginReleases to externalResolver ## expectation  * My understanding is that sbtPlugin should be true if you have a project that implements a plugin. It shouldn\'t be enabled automatically. Why is it being enabled in the autoPlugin initialization? * Both sutra and sbtPluginReleases are hard-coded within SBT. Why does SBT prepend hardcoded repositories into the resolvers?  ## notes  ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

sbt,3192,open,2,2017-05-15 03:50:32,95.1,,,1,b'b\' Hey Eugene," thank you for taking the time to think about this. Regarding your questions I think they are all answered with ""yes"". It means that there is no way for someone: (1) to trigger the task from the shell", (2) refer to it inside their own settings or tasks, and (3) to see it listed under help and get it auto-completed. These  are only there to be used from within the plugin code. Now," a natural question for you to ask is: ""Why don\\\'t you define them to be just constants and functions?"" Well", I want these  to be executed in the right . So if my private task asks for the name or the version or classpath or whatever, I want it to get the values defined by the scope it currently runs on. So if it\\\'s called on a subproject it will behave differently than if it get\\\'s called from ThisBuild, etc. Probably, I can just define these as functions and then make sure I pass the proper arguments to them all the way, but (personally I feel that) defining them as  makes it a bit more idiomatic sbt?

If I don\\\'t tell my users the settings are there and they cannot autocomplete them and they need to use the TaskKey(""myPrivateKey"") to get it working then that would solve 99% of what I worry about.

The other thing you need to take care of is the sbt shell. By default, the commands that show and inspect the settings will show your private setting no matter if it\'s private or not.  To my surprise, however, I have stumbled upon something that may be *really* useful here: the concept of local settings and tasks. Those local settings and tasks, to my best knowledge, fulfill your need: they are invisible (i.e. not shown on inspect and completions).  In  , you have an example of how they are used:  At compile-time, will have a generated free name (this is created in  , inside  ), so local settings and tasks don\'t have a name, only an identifier where they are created.  It seems that local settings and tasks were hacked to support files and it seems that they do exactly what you want.  I suggest that you: * Play around with local tasks. * Put them in a place where they are only accessible to your plugin, like or something similar.

It seems like this issue is broadly related to the cake pattern, which is used heavily in some older parts of the quasar codebase (sadface\\xe2\\x80\\xa6).  Changing upstream functions (in inherited traits) will cause some downstream compilation units to explode at runtime with due to Zinc improperly believing the files in question did not need to be invalidated.  This happens intermittently in local development (my steps below point to a changeset which will reproduce the issue) and 100% deterministically in CI.  The reason it is happening deterministically in CI is because we cache our target directories for PR builds in Travis (as discussed with @jvican) in order to bring down our horrendously-long compilation times.  This worked almost flawlessly with SBT 0.13.x for the last eight months (we only needed to cache flush twice), which is quite impressive!  However, on SBT 1.0, we can\'t even get a single PR build to work, as the slower matrix builds will get the new caches from the faster builds, and themselves run into mutual-invalidation issues.  This is kind of an edge case," but it does demonstrate how much less reliable current Zinc is from its state in 0.13.  ## steps  1. Clone [my fork of quasar]url  2. Check out commit 3. Run 4.

[The plugin best practices]url  are relatively new and I agree with the style that is recommended there.  This is mostly due to my experience with configurations", which should be used in a very narrow use case. Separating tests is IMHO not a good use case. User usually struggle enough with scoping. When a basic task such as running tests requires are deep understanding of sbt to configure something, then we should avoid this.  2. Overriding all settings with makes things more explicit and easier to debug, because settings are selected from one configuration and not partially from two. This is again from my personal experience with scoping that at time can be very confusing For me this is a symptom of the documented way. If we recommend users to use partial settings, we can break any setting at any time when changing some of the defaults. So rather than fixing symptoms I would like to recommend a more explicit style of configurations and try to steer users away from configurations. The only thing required to share tests is overriding the  . I would change the docs to this," if this makes sense to you :smile: ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
sbt,4038,open,9,2018-03-26 08:41:44,155.78,,1,,"b'b""  While normally", I\'d agree. The reason we use a separate configuration (and why I assume the docs do too) is to allow for different and parallel execution settings. Also, we use multiple frameworks, so bundling everything under a config makes things nice and easy to maintain. If there\'s a better way, I\'d love to know about it.  We still use ScalaTest tagging to control which tests to run, but we also modify  ,  ,  , and for the different configs. If we could simply create new tests tasks with these settings overridden and avoid all the scoping issues that would be great. I totally agree, but you also now have the situation where SBT regressed and broke things for users. The documented way to do things is broken and has been broken for a long time. I\'m not sure what the policy is for regressions, but shouldn\'t there be an actual fix (updated docs or a code fix) before closing this? The reason why I\'m arguing for a code fix is simply that this is a regression and deprecations should happen with warning. Makes sense, but we actually have to do quite a bit more. We have a semi-complicated multi-project build and we rely on the inheritance of settings via configurations to set and similar settings at the highest level so the other configurations inherit it automatically. We would now have to override these settings for every single configuration instead of the just base configuration. We could explicitly call to the base settings for anything we override in our custom  , but I\'d argue that\'s no better than the partial settings issue you identified. Finally, while I don\'t disagree with the overall sentiment, part of the reason why I care so much about this is I\'m on a quest to reduce the number of explicit settings we have. Our SBT load times are terrible and while I know there are much bigger optimizations SBT needs to make," one thing I can control is the number of settings that have to be resolved for each project.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are various small workarounds we can try to reduce the pressure on Metaspace (a space in the native heap of Java Virtual Machine where class metadata is stored)", but we agreed that we need to _remove_ the use of from launchers and launch scripts since it aggravates the problem by putting an arbitrary limit.
