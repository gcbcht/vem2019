Sure", you can make static pages, but they don\\\'t get the same processing and you cannot perform any iteration functions on them. Most sites I visited through the examples have static pages which could probably be better served under a different configuration namespace (I\\\'m using the term \\\'namespace\\\' as used by media wiki," posts across namespaces are separate but equal (although some are more equal than others)).  Here is an example:When adding a new page to their ""projects""", they have to add it to the menu.  If the project .md file was within the it could be iterated and automatically added to the menu and other pages which list all projects.\\\'Blog posts\\\' are traditionally akin to a newspaper article, publish once.  \\\'Wiki\\\' notes are different, notes should be updated and removed with the times.  And project pages probably somewhere in between.  Although, I can have a wiki note, blog post," and project page about a single subject (read: category).  The ""classification"" allows for a person to develop their OWN culture on their site.  I think it\\\'s a good first start towards something bigger. (disclaimer: I think this is a good start", however," more needs to be fleshed out with this process as it is a paradigm shift.  if you use the ""notes"" and ""projects"" mentality", you should not have to date the file. e.g. use date, do not.)\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The main point of was to provide a way to list and find posts according to one of the front matter attributes like we can do for or (with or  ). The ideas behind this are to :make it easy to classify posts according to many criteria index them on different pages easily after that. It\\\'s easy in jekyll to do a but it becomes harder if you try to represent a hierarchy or try to get all tags used with one particular tag to build one. I had 2 real use cases for this : ## Use case 1: Provide multiples  axes Use jekyll to index  demos and allow users to browse and find them by:project,library (or html framework),component,"or basic html5 elements where each demo could be indexed in multiple components or elements. This is not a ""released"" project but you can still access it here: url  and use top navigation to get the idea of what I\\\'m talking about. By using the following configuration : and using the following example front matter: or  The top level navigation becomes quite simple: Sublevel Navigation becomes: ## Use case 2: Nested hierarchy An other use case was in a documentation website"," using classifications to build a hierarchy that looks like: Here we use the following config file: We\\\'ll then use to define internal chapters and for the public chapters. Here is an example front matter: Then it\\\'s easy to build a main top-nav for the internal part (or the public part) with: and here is a simplified version of a side bar grouping posts in sections for a chapter(this one will work as long as you don\\\'t use the ""section"" classification to classify public doc but it\\\'s easy to use something) : Sorry for the long post", I hope it makes it easier to see use cases solved with this feature.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Assuming old permalink behavior is :skull: and new permalink behavior is :crown:, here\'s what I propose. Glad to start submitting PR\'s if there\'s a :+1::## On the Jekyll core side of things:1. Create a flag, which defaults to  2. Turning the flag to on in reverts to the old permalink behavior but throws a deprecation warning.3. Add a big red box to the [upgrading page]url 4. Plan to kill in a future version This would move new sites over to the new default, and if a site breaks, they can easily unbreak with a single config var (and would be gently pushed to upgrade their permalinks on each build).## On the Pages side of things:1. GitHub pages will set the default to but allow users to override via their (there\'s precedence for this in how pygments, safe, etc. are handled)2. Add a call out to [the help docs]url  This would mean that **we don\'t break any Pages sites** :tada: making basically zero pain for the user. The only potential pain point would be for users running 1.0.x locally, which would have different permalink behavior by default.1. I\'d rather break sites locally, then on Pages. There\'s much, much, much less downside2. A user running locally is going to be sophisticated enough to add a var to a file3. Users who are seeing strange results locally are already accustomed to going to help docs to see what version / flags Pages is running, where they will find the answer simply enough.4. They could always e-mail support to fix their local build, while the live site continues to build.## Things that would be good to have1. A command, or a gist with a rake task, etc. that would upgrade permalinks (I\'m imagining a site with 1000\'s of pages)2. A deprecation warning if I have on, and a page in the folder  , has a permalink of  ## Other options discussed:1. Rip bandaid2. Switch in Jekyll core to opt-in3.

The example above highlights what I\'d like to achieve: place our docs pages in a directory, keep the compiled CSS and JS files we generate and track via Git in  , and then have Jekyll build from both those. The current solution to this would be a build script or manually copy-pasta, but that sucks and puts the burden on others to solve. Given Jekyll already has the ability to specify contents to generate and exclude, I don\'t think this is too far fetched. Symlinks would solve this easily, but they aren\'t allowed in GitHub Pages. Perhaps there can be rules for GHP using Jekyll with select folders? Dunno the security risks there (perhaps @benbalter can weigh in).

Wanting to put Jekyll in a sub-folder within a larger project so that the project\'s directory structure is clear2. Wanting to allow Jekyll to read from two source folders ## Sub-foldering We want to encourage people to use Jekyll for project docs. That\'s the whole point. You can do the Bootstrap route and put the docs right in the folder", or you can have a separate gh-pages branch, which can cause all sorts of headaches. Not to mention, I think there\'s something huge to be said about versioning docs along side code, especially when you do tags / releases. You can put files any place you want (including a docs folder), and just use permalinks to move them to the proper place. The only limitation on this as far as I can tell is the folders (includes, layouts, etc.). What about some mechanism that allows Jekyll to look to and  ? Or maybe something that automatically sub-folders the site to as site root? ## Multiple source folders This is fine for core if it doesn\'t add too much complexity, but can you think of another use case? (Note: would need to change command-line behavior as well). We currently override this on Pages for practical (and security) reasons. Not sure how we could support it, unless it were a non-source config variable that specified sub-folders of the source (e.g, or or something). ## Building @mdo would native build support for less, etc. help your problem? (#1277) **Edit**: Thinking through this some more, I think either a config (which would be relative to source), or, even better, in terms of sane defaults, a boolean," which would essentially set what would be to or both is the best route to versioning Jekyll sites along side code.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In my particular use case, I put in my  , but as already said, this applies only to posts and the pages still are like (rather than  , which would be consistent with  ). I know that my PR with the introduction of a binary variable is less than ideal, but my primary goal was to retain backwards compatibility. All the people that are using already have links to pages without the file extension: if we introduce a new setting that by default has the current behaviour ( )," I can imagine a lot of links broken when these people upgrade their version of jekyll.

Note, that all this isn\'t a premature optimization. It\'s in fact a big step towards cleaner CSS code for the future ;) Everyone tends to add new stuff, but only few people clean up the old stuff :D Now, how about the vendor prefixes?

I wouldn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t call IE9 ancient though\\xe2\\x80\\x94even on sites with very forward-thinking audiences it sees pretty heavy usage, often because of heavily locked down corporate IT environments. On GitHub for example, we typically see about 20% of our IE traffic coming from IE9. This is a reasonably tiny sliver of our _overall_ usage though, and our CSS bundle is already pretty large, so we don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t bother with svg gradients.

If you\'re using RVM, it seems updating the psych gem affects the current Ruby, which fixes the problem, unless you\'re using Bundler, in which case you also need to add to your Gemfile. If you have Ruby installed system-wide, on the other hand, I\'m not sure updating the psych gem accomplishes anything. I could be wrong about that. However, if you\'re using Ubuntu, updating the libyaml-0-2 package introduces a backported fix which SafeYAML won\'t detect (see #57). My understanding is that if you are using the latest version of RVM, the new autolibs feature will compile Ruby with the libyaml fix for you (hence the fix that @boyanpenkov just mentioned). I could be wrong about that, too. What I just wrote is basically the sum of my rough memory of little spats of troubleshooting I\'ve had time to put in here and there over the past couple days. It could be inaccurate in the details; but what I _am_ confident about is that there are unfortunate inconsistencies in how to resolve this issue between systems. This is something I obviously need to figure out and fix (by providing a more helpful warning message, where appropriate) in the near future.

I\\\'m putting it here in an issue to open a broader discussion, if anyone cares, about the best approach to this. Currently," a Collection\\\'s ""relative_directory"" is set to the Collection label. The documentation is a bit confusing here", because one can apparently access the relative_directory, but not configure it. I believe it will be better for users, including content creators, to optionally organize their collections into a folder or folders. So, is it best to be able to set each Collection\\\'s directory, or set all Collections\\\' directory, or set aside (thinking of a previous conversation on this) the _includes and _layouts folder so everything else is content?

Rather than introduce any new config settings, my intent is to just make the current behavior a little smarter with regard to URL endings for pages and collections based on the setting, which is the confusion that @bcomnes initially described. So my intended behavior for page URLs is something like:if you have  , then use the current logic.  That is:  html index pages use  other html pages use  all other pages use  if you have or  , use the current logic for that, which means all pages use  otherwise, page URLs should match the ending style specified in  .  That is:  if ends with a trailing slash, then use  if ends with  , then use  if uses extensionless URLs (neither trailing slash or  ), then use  . HTML index pages will continue to just use  , and non-HTML pages will always use  . (**edit:** another way to say all that is that page URLs simply always match post URLs with regard to their ending style.  The extra logic is only there to handle the built-in permalink styles pretty, none, and date) Default permalinks for collections follow the same basic logic, barring index pages and such where not applicable. It sounds like a lot of logic, but it\'s really not too bad.  And honestly I think it\'s much more intuitive than the current behavior," and still only needs the single config setting.

I got a copy of the Jekyll source code and tried to track down where it reads from the files. There\'s a ().join() that I spotted while trying to find my way through the source code but I\'ll probably have to keep shovelling to get to the right point in the code. Meanwhile, I also tried to reproduce the issue with a simple Ruby script that reads from a file and displays the output with a  followed by File_ and that didn\'t seem to have an issue with a UTF-8 file with a BOM (I used Notepad++ to convert a text file to UTF-8 with BOM). I used Ruby 2.1.5 x64 on Windows 8.1 for trying it so I\'m not sure if it\'s something that the newer versions of Ruby handle the BOM, or if it\'s because I\'m calling the open and read methods for file reading and Jekyll calls a different set of methods, or maybe even Notepad++ left the file unchanged for some reason.

Front matter defaults would also apply, so doing this for a larger number of files would be trivial.2. Those formats would use the same layout as for the HTML page, but with the new ending, e.g. when in the document.3. The layout would define the behaviour. Whether you want JSON, CSV, XML, or some other output, the layout would be in charge of manipulating the data into the desired output.4. They would have identical permalinks with the exception of the extension. In the case of permalinks, it would be accessible at for consistency.5. Accessing this link in Liquid would be  ,  , etc. The extension would be stripped of all non-alphanumerical characters and would be used as a prefix for  . **If you comment, please do not simply write :+1:.

If I make a single modification to a file, Jekyll will incrementally regenerate just that one file, but it\'ll do so in a continuous loop every few seconds. For example, with one modification to an HTML file: This also happens when I run Jekyll with no custom plugins ( ). When I revert to using Jekyll 2.5.2, it\'ll regenerate the whole site (slowly)," but just once.

I would short-circuit some of that (but I\'d have to reread the entire class to get a firm grasp on it to see if it could be organized in a better way.) On the metadata part, if that is the case then please do marshal it to a single file instead of a folder of files because meta data is small, but the file amount will be high, files are expensive and it will be cheaper in the long run to store it in a single file than thousands of smaller files.  The cost of data storage and IO only benefits from large files (from my experience.) That said," I must also imply that if it cannot keep track of itself between runs (and it\'s not a persistent process) that in and of itself adds a performance penalty that doesn\'t necessarily add a benefit to using this no?  Unless I am completely misunderstanding but from what I\'m to believe you would need to wrap around as a server with  and track these file changes efficiently and proc off into a run.

I\'m just going through all the old issues and pull requests and deciding what to pursue and what to kindly thank-but-no-thank. In your case, I would like to see sorting be configurable.  I like your implementation, but I think it has some security concerns. Specifically, building code and executing it could be very dangerous. We have [a method as part of the Liquid filters]url  whose code does something similar to what you\'re doing here. Think it could be co-opted to this cause? I wonder if there\'s a way to incorporate into the sorter in a safe way. Would this suffice? Additionally, are you still interested in working on the code for this?

Yeah I\'ve seen the before working on this one, but if I remember well it doesn\'t support multiple properties order (ie.  ), or nested properties (ie. as in #3539). The first implementation I made wasn\'t using code generation, but as @envygeeks was concerned about performance, I tested some different ways to do it, benchmarked them and went with the parsing + generated one since it was much faster (you can see #3720 for the discussion and [-bench]url  for the benchmarks). I added some safety guards ([validation Regexp]url  and a customizable [limit]url  of generated sort methods) to prevent evaluation of arbitrary code and high  consumption. I can add more safety checks or fallback to any non code-generating version if you prefer, it\'s really up to you (and maybe the average number of items to sort in collections hosted on GitHub Pages).Using a method to access the hash like [this one]url  works, is safe, but is also much slower. Whatever configuration format you prefer is also fine by me as long as it supports multiple and nested sorting (all of them are safe and simple to parse, it\'s really the method that matters). Using and or  ,  ,  , or doesn\'t make much of a difference to me and should be quite easy to change once decided (naming is always the hardest part \\xf0\\x9f\\x98\\x81  ).""'

While installing in the manner you suggest does solve the problem of putting Jekyll\\\'s Ruby in an isolated environment, I have had fewer gem conflicts when using a version that is slightly older than what Homebrew will give you. To facilitate that, might I suggest pointing to any of the various Ruby managers out there and people can choose which one suits their needs.

Lastly, to provide a definitive answer regarding SIP and available directories, the following information is directly from Session 706.

As it has been disclosed [elsewhere]url  and El Capitan is scheduled to ship next week, this is likely considered public knowledge.  \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jekyll,4510,closed,body,2016-02-11 21:52:38,00:00,,,1,"b'b"" Similar to what we did with Gem-based plugins", we should introduce the concept of Gem-based themes, making it easier for users to style their content, and hopefully creating a more robust theme ecosystem.### How themes work today Today, while there are lots of great Jekyll themes out there, the installation process generally involves either forking a repo or copying files into the destination site. The problem with this approach, beyond ease of use and the ability to quickly switch themes, is that there\'s no good way to downstream subsequent updates (not to mention, from a DRY perspective, the theme\'s CSS and templates now exist in hundreds or thousands of repos, each with their own versions and edits).### How Gem-based themes would work for users Find a theme you like? Simply add in your site\'s file. That\'ll instruct Jekyll to load the Gem-based theme, just like it would any plugin. The theme would be able to register layouts, and its static assets (css, javascript, images, etc.) would be automatically included in the built site. Heck, maybe there\'s even an  , or similar, to include the theme\'s assets in your HTML. Lets say the theme has a layout. If you don\'t like it, simply create a layout in your standard folder with the same name. At render time Jekyll will first look to the user\'s layouts and includes, and if one doesn\'t exist, it\'ll then look to the theme\'s. As an added bonus, if you\'re just using the theme defaults, we\'ve allowed you to better separate content from presentation, as your repo is now almost entirely your own content, with less Jekyll noise getting in your way.### How Gem-based themes would work for theme creators Themes are just Gems with a defined folder structure, not unlike the Jekyll site itself. The only required file would be the Gemspec itself. Beyond that, you can introduce as many layouts you\'d like, in a folder, the same with  . For assets, the folder can automatically be included in sass\'s include path (meaning the user could just do to include your css in there own). We can also define some sort of ( ?) folder, which\'ll be automatically included as a whole, in the built site. Heck, maybe themes can even be dependencies of other themes (e.g., a vanilla Bootstrap theme might be a dependency of Hyde). We\'ll probably also want to include a screenshot in a predictable path.### A note on security From a GitHub Pages perspective, it\'d be important to us that themes not be allowed to contain any server-side executable code (e.g., only liquid-based logic). As far as I understand it, the Gemspec isn\'t executed once the Gem is built. That would allow us to very quickly whitelist a large number of themes for use with GitHub Pages (and would then not have to strictly version each), allowing theme developers to push updates to Rubygems, which would then update the version used by GitHub Pages, without requiring (much) human intervention. If themes need advanced functionality, they can require a plugin (which could go through the existing review process).### A note on conventions Right now, everyone has their own design patterns. Is it or  ? or  ? or  ? For themes to be truly fungible, we\'ll probably want to put out some sort of style guide for themes, describing common design patterns, and how best to implement them in cross-theme ways.### A note on our own theme If we went down this path, the default Jekyll theme (that\'s bundled with Jekyll), would be pulled out into its own Gem. could them simply create the necessary config and folder structure. Heck, maybe could even take a theme name and be capable to generate a boilerplate site for any theme. Thoughts? I Know there\'s some prior art within Octopress, but think making themes first class citizens of the Jekyll world, like we did for plugins, could go a long way to level up the Jekyll publishing experience," especially for new users.""'"

jekyll,4510,closed,4,2016-02-11 21:52:38,559.53,,,1,b'b\' Hello," if I may add my two cents on themeing. I\\\'d say ideally you can simply ""link"" in a theme to your site in the theme folder using a git submodule (or low-tech just unpack a theme zip archive). See Hugo or other site builders / generators where it works today. That way you can", for example," install a couple of themes (lets say three) and ideally switch the theme just by changing the settings in  .  Bundling up themes into gems would be a nice extra. Keep it up. Cheers.

jekyll,4510,closed,7,2016-02-11 21:52:38,171.78,,,1,b'b\' The challenge with submodules, is that there\\\'s a high degree of technical complexity involved. I\\\'ve been using Git for years and I still have to look up the commands each time. Not to mention, it requires you to have Git locally and feel comfortable using the command line.  In terms of subsequent upstream updates, there\\\'s no way to semantically version a git submodule, meaning you just have to blinding update to the latest version. And unlike all other dependencies (Kramdown, Rouge, etc.), the theme would have its own upgrade process, independent of  , and in the case of zip files, that gets even more complicated, as you\\\'re taking things out of version control completely.Yes! This should be possible," with what I described above. You could have multiple themes ""installed"" by adding them to your Gemfile", and could switch between them by simply changing an option in your config file.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jekyll,4510,closed,8,2016-02-11 21:52:38,23.0,,,1,b'b\' @benbalter  The idea is that a theme is just a git repo, that is," a bunch of files and folders. A ""normal"" user just unpacks an archive in the theme folder. I\\\'d argue that bundling up a theme into a Rubygem is beyond most users skills. The idea is to keep it as simple a possible e.g. just a bunch of files (in a git repo).  Using a theme ""linked"" in with a git module is just an ""advanced"" option as would be using a ""gem"". As mentioned above Hugo might be a ""real world"" model to study (for inspiration) see url as are other static or dynamic site builders such as WordPress and others.  Anyways", thanks for the consideration and thanks for all the great plugins (avatar, seo, sitemap, feed, etc.) and the GitHub Pages push to Jekyll 3. Keep it up.

jekyll,4510,closed,9,2016-02-11 21:52:38,6.78,,,1,"b'b"" @geraldb Totally with you", and in what I\'m proposing above, themes are just repos, so the above would be possible for those that prefer. The biggest limitation with unpacking an archive is that it requires command-line, or at least local access. Imagine a completely wed-based publishing flow, where you simply choose a theme and start adding content.  Not to mention, there\'s something to be said for separating content from presentation and DRYing up Jekyll sites. For most users, there\'s no reason to have a third-party theme cluttering up their site\'s version control (or to have 30,000 different versions floating around, each with one edit never surfaced upstream). The other limitation is that archive or submodule based themes are limited to one folder, so while assets (css, javascript) may copy cleanly, things like vendoring layouts and includes do not, as you cannot currently have multiple layout or include folders.  The other advantage of the above is an idea similar to WordPress\'s template hierarchy, in which I theme can have a  , but if I don\'t like it, I can add my own to my site (not modifying the theme itself), which Jekyll could use instead, still giving me access to includes, other templates, assets, etc. See where you\'re coming from, and a big fan of Hugo," I\'m hoping the Jekyll theme ecosystem can (and should be) much bigger than one repo would safely allow! :smile:""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
jekyll,4510,closed,10,2016-02-11 21:52:38,2.17,,,1,"b'b\' @benbalter If I may add one more comment:I\\\'d argue that keeping the option of just a bunch of files and folders that you can copy or more ""advanced"" link into a theme folder will make it easier (in addition to the option for bundled gems) e.g.:GitHub does NOT need to whitelist any themes (less work and more choice) and", thus,Jekyll users can use whatever theme they like  even on GitHub Pages.I\\\'m a actually a fan of Jekyll  (see my little [themes collection]url  for example) ;-)  Hugo was just an example. WordPress I\\\'d say is a better example e.g. works the same, that is," without any gems ;-) just unpack the theme e.g. bunch of files and folders into a ""dedicated"" theme folder.  Of course", Jekyll needs to get updated for theme-ing e.g. so there\\\'s a hierachy of lookups for files (if not found in themes/[theme-name] try layouts etc.).  PS: Just to make sure I\\\'m all for using bundled gems for themes the argument is that it should be an option and just a bunch of files and folders (following a convention of course a la WordPress or similar) works too. Just my two cents. Again thanks all your efforts moving Jekyll forward and keeping GitHub Pages up-to-date. Keep it up. Cheers.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

jekyll,4510,closed,12,2016-02-11 21:52:38,1047.37,1,,,"b'b\' IMHO two nice additions would be: 1)  Each theme and every asset and partial html file used to render the theme should reside in the same folder. Basically I\\\'m suggesting to drop ""_include"" and ""_layouts"" folders and the  in the root folder of the website"," and use instead a ""_themes"" folder. Inside the _themes folder you should have one subfolder for each theme For example: Default theme Alternative theme Every partial / include file should reside in a subfolder inside the theme folder. You could decide for example that every theme folder MUST have an _include folder", and that everytime Liquid finds a {% include %} tag, the included file should be picked up from that folder. I\\\'m thinking about a themes folder structured this way:  2) Each theme subfolder should contain another _ where you could store some preferences that would help defining how that theme should be rendered by Jekyll. For example, during the next holidays you could decide to set an option to change the look of the theme... for example by setting this: and Jekyll and the theme author could use that parameter to display some festive images (dunno... an image of santa claus riding his sled with the reindeers that flies up in the air on the background of the website... some christmas decorations here and there...)When the holidays are over you could simply turn that option to false, rebuild the pages and turn the site back to its previous look.

jekyll,4610,closed,21,2016-02-29 20:55:02,1293.82,,,1,"b'b"" Ok", after talking for a while with @benbalter, I\'m happy with the decision to move forward with Gem-based themes _only_. The advantages to gem-based themes are significant:1. Less prone to errors when sharing either your site or your theme ( \\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f \\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f \\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f \\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f \\xf0\\x9f\\x8c\\x9f )2. We will ship a command,  , which makes the creation of the files and directories a one-step process. It will include instructions as well as a scaffold.3. Private, ad-hoc themes are still supported through  (private repo) or local (  in Gemfile) distribution.4. A little added overhead for the theme creator makes it _much_ simpler for users. Versioning (including, crucially, the ability to roll back to a previous version) is paramount here. This decision took me a couple weeks of thought which is much longer than I usually take for these sorts of things. I read all the comments above and talked it out at length with Ben, arguing that it should be configurable. Ultimately, he convinced me that the need for a wonderful user experience for the consumer of a theme (not the producer) over many months and years is what is important. Cloning a repository to some random location on your machine and pointing your config there is not a sustainable way to solve the problem of shared layouts, includes, and styles. As an implementation detail, we will have to setup load paths for layouts & includes anyway, so a plugin could easily inject more paths if it so chose. With that, I\'m going to close this PR. @spudowiar, feel free to add support you added here for multiple directories to #4595," leaving out the configuration via  .

Misusing causes all sorts of problems when rendering locally or across forks, and I swear I\'ve seen it done wrong more times than done right. One _nice_ thing about baseurl, however, is that it can be overridden via the command line via flag. There\'s a common design pattern where might be  , used to build paths throughout templates, and then locally, is set to or when previewing the site, preserving URLs.

jekyll,5049,open,4,2016-07-02 18:39:55,75.15,,,1,b'b\' I\\\'m not sure I understand your statement or your opposition. Currently, Jekyll is copying each static file. With large files, this is slow.  With the patch, enabling hardlinks causes Jekyll to link the files instead. This is significantly faster as it essentially only has to create a directory entry and increment a link count. As for OS or file system support, every modern OS supports link. Certainly Windows supports it and it\\\'s part of [POSIX]url  As for file system support, it\\\'s supported on EXT2/3/4, JFS, ReiserFS, btrfs, FFS, UFS, XFS, HFS+, ZFS,and NTFS (among, I\\\'m sure, many others). The file systems that I know don\\\'t support it FAT12/16/32, exFAT," and Plan 9. I don\\\'t understand what you mean about not knowing how they behave on various file systems? ""The function shall atomically create a new link for the existing file and the link count of the file shall be incremented by one.""  Do you mean the subtle point in the POSIX specification about how it behaves when linking to a symlink being implementation dependent? If so", that seems easy to canonicalize the behavior by calling on the source first. Maybe I\\\'m misunderstood your point. As a single data point, building the small site I\\\'m working on that contains about 4 GB of static files takes about 11 seconds without hard links and about 1.3 seconds with.

jekyll,5049,open,14,2016-07-02 18:39:55,682.82,,1,,"b'b"" @ashmaroli Ideally", hard links would be made for files on the same file system and files would be copied for files on different file systems. As it\'s currently implemented, it doesn\'t check for that and hard links would simply not work in the scenario where the destination of the copy is not the same file system as the source.  @pathawks then I think the PR should just be closed since it seems like Jekyll developers are opposed. I admit, I don\'t really understand the opposition. Being able to create hard links is a pretty massive speed up for my site which has 5 files that together are more than 7 GB. (They are VM images for my students.)  I also don\'t really understand the contention that this should be handled by the file system itself. Many file systems support hard links but most don\'t handle the sort of deduping necessary to make this process fast.  Incremental builds aren\'t really an option either since they don\'t properly track changes in data files (or correctly handle generated content in some cases). I spent a little time trying to wrap an external dependency tracking around an incremental Jekyll build," but it was error-prone  I agree that this is unlikely to be a bottleneck for most sites (and I believe the default was to have hard links disabled). But it\'s a pretty minimal change with nice performance benefits.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For one, it would allow people to publish sites to GitHub Pages (and other Jekyll-based platforms) without being constrained to whitelisted themes," and remove the burden of having to ""unbundle"" themes using the [awkward process]url  described in the Jekyll docs.

In all of these cases, support for a directory has the potential to make the user\\\'s life easier. They can try a theme out by copying it to and updating their Jekyll config, rather than monkeying with Bundler. They can publish their theme to GitHub without having to know how to publish a Gem. Theme users can install and keep the theme up-to-date with git submodules.

I also agree that Gem-based themes are much easier to install for people who are familiar with Gems and Ruby. However, they\\\'re not usable on GitHub Pages unless they\\\'re on GitHub\\\'s very short whitelist. And for people who are less familiar with Ruby but know their way around the filesystem enough to put a simple Jekyll site together, I think that directory-based themes would be a huge boon.  Some context: I work for the U.S. government and am on the [Web Design Standards]url  team. We\\\'re looking at creating a Jekyll theme for the Standards that people with little to no git or GitHub (let alone Ruby or Gem) experience can use and deploy on GitHub Pages and other Jekyll-based platforms, such as [Federalist]url  Federalist builds Jekyll sites in containerized environments and doesn\\\'t restrict Gems, so we can scaffold new sites with a Gem-based theme there. But some agencies and departments can and do publish directly to GitHub Pages," which means that we need to provide additional tooling to ""unbundle"" a Gem-based Standards theme and apply updates to the theme. If directory-based themes were a thing", then we could scaffold those sites with set up as a git submodule that points to the theme repo, and every hosting environment would be able to handle it. Directory-based themes are also easier for users to run locally because they don\\\'t necessarily involve having to use Bundler at all: clone the repo with (or use the GitHub desktop app), and if you have Jekyll installed globally you can just run in the project directory. \\xf0\\x9f\\x92\\xa5 In short: directory-based themes offer a simpler mechanism for distribution that\\\'s compatible with hosting environments that don\\\'t allow arbitrary Gems, and are potentially much easier for users to run locally.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I just wanted to +1000 the suggestion proposed by others before me, and provide some more specific use cases.  I think the core concept of scaffold directories makes sense, and I assume that the Gem-based theme implementation already provides some way to prepend resolution paths for different types of files (includes, layouts, Sass partials). If I knew Ruby well enough I\\\'d dive right in and see if I could hack together a solution, but I humbly defer to the maintainers and Jekyll hackers on whether this is an easily implemented feature.  Here\\\'s how I would expect it to work, assuming in the Jekyll config:  1. Attempt to require the gem  . If that succeeds," add its ""scaffold directories"" to the appropriate resolution paths", and perform any other Gem-based theme initialization necessary. 1. Otherwise, check for the existence of in the source dir. If that exists, add all of its scaffold directories to the resolution paths instead. 1. If the directory doesn\\\'t exist, throw an error.

The best solution hence is to develop an in-house theme to cater to this niche scenario and implement it via Front Matter Defaults:  each book is a collection item with entries as chapters:  ,"   delegate these ""books"" with a of their own:     these individual layouts descend from the parent layout say  this allows scalability and write new layouts / use existing ones for new books \''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

At least some of those themes are only really built for a single page.  When a project wants to grow beyond that (ex. add documentation pages) it may be perfectly willing to accept a different theme for the new (documentation) pages to to  spending the time working on themes or being forced to change the appearance of its current page.  The other case that I thought of because of projects I have worked near", but was not actually attempted is similar to @arthurattwell\'s.  The case of a project where its main website and its documentation website were developed separately, and ended up with different themes. As they have grown," it has become clear there would be efficiencies in merging the two.

Instead, I used the following command.   It seems as though the following is also a viable solution.   I\'m afraid that I disagree with @DirtyF I believe this is a problem for Jekyll.

Since the YAML file is machine-readable, it would be trivial for an application to read its name from the same YAML source as the documentation. Changing the app name would be a simple matter of updating a single YAML file, which simultaneously updates all references in the documentation.  This could be an option passed into Jekyll to maintain backwards compatibility.  Using is insufficient here because of namespace clashes. There are a couple of options:  * Jekyll can read all the Markdown files alongside and pass them through a pre-processor; or * can specify the pre-processor file(s) to use against all, or specific, Markdown files.  The first is easier," the second is more flexible.'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, part of the problem is that the variables must be able to reference other variables, with a variable interpolator to extract the correct dereferenced value (see  , above).  The collection attributes almost fits the bill, but has the stringent requirement of not being a standalone YAML file (i.e., must be part of Markdown front matter).

The first is about [19 lines of code]url  The second requires a kind of [variable decorator pattern]url  which is also fairly trivial in terms of LoC (fewer than 50 lines).

I want to be able to specify the order of items in a collection and have  links respect that.  **Use Case**  I am using Jekyll to build a lesson that contains several topics.

Topics must be listed on the home page in a particular order", and we want topics to have  links set correctly.  **What Doesn\'t Work**  We currently enforce ordering using a naming convention: topics are called  ,  ,  , etc. This works, but when we want to re-order topics, we need to rename many files whose content often hasn\'t changed, which makes the version control log difficult to interpret.  We have tried using a list in to specify order:   and then using that loop and to create the ordered list in the home page:   However, his doesn\'t help with  links within the topics. The only solution I\'ve been able to come up with for that is to use a search loop inside each topic to find it within the list, but that means that building the site is O(N**2), since the search loop over N topics is run once for each topic," and that makes builds noticeably slower for large lessons with 20-30 topics.  **What Might Work**  1.  Support an key in the metadata for each collection whose value is the ordered list of IDs of collection members. Values in the list that don\'t correspond to collection members are errors; collection members that are not listed are either an error or omitted.  2.

jekyll,5867,closed,body,2017-02-07 09:35:11,00:00,,,1,b'b\' I\\\'m working with jekyll themes at the moment btw. thanks for this long waited feature and coming around with an feature request to **support frontmatter header in include files**.  **Why?** When composing themes, includes are typically used for functional blocks (for example a contact form or image gallery) which could be used on every page. These blocks have some preconfigured settings (in this example text, form fields, or images to include) for this include. For a better readability of the template those settings (or parameters) should be included and preconfigured in the header. When somebody wants to overwrite the include file he should copy the file and change the header.  I know that siteand pageparams exists," but sometimes they are not enough for writing functional parts of a template.  Example implementation:  _  (use default setting)  {% include  %}  would Result: Hello world.  index2.html (overwrite by param)  {% include  headline=""Hello USA!"" %}  would Result: Hello USA!  What do you think of this request? I\\\'m the only one who thinks this is useful?

We know not all tickets require those steps. Otherwise, please try to be as detailed as possible.  If you are unsure this is a bug in Jekyll, or this is a bug caused by a plugin that isn\'t directly related to Jekyll, or if this is just a generic usage question, please consider asking your question at url  where non-bug questions go.  Please make sure to mention an affinity team whose responsibilities most closely align with your issue.  Thanks! -[x] I believe this to be a bug, not a question about using Jekyll.

Such as the directories you created and, the full command you ran, and include any plugins you have installed, this is very important.  If your steps are complicated, you can also submit a GitHub repository (please no zips, they will be removed and rejected by maintainers,) and just supply a command for us to reproduce it ourselves. 1. Configure Bundler to install deps to my project directories instead of GEM_HOME 2. Initialize a project directory 3. Update project Gemfile contents 4. Install Jekyll to the project directory and create a new site with default scaffolding ## The Output I Wanted I expected that Jekyll would write the default site scaffolding into the current directory (project root), overwrite _my_ Gemfile, and default site dependencies from _its_ Gemfile (e.g., minima) to . <!-Insert the output from the command. Alter it as little as you can. The minimum should be personal information. Though we normally don\'t log anything like that so there should be no need to alter it.

To avoid errors, my workaround has been to replace step 4 with:  I have also tried some other things after installing Jekyll to GEM_HOME with  .

We do this because our website and documentation are constructed from various sources, including both static pages and docs generated from source code. We have a [script]url  that extracts the tar archive into a temporary directory and then run to bring up a local instance of the website.  I am working on migrating the website out of the [ source tree]url  and into its own repository at [-website]url  When setting up the [  script]url  in -website, I noticed that when running the script, Jekyll was emitting some rather odd errors:   Note that in this case, the pwd is  , which itself looks like a valid Jekyll source tree.  Eventually, I suspected that the reason for these errors was that the command was being run from a directory that itself could be a valid Jekyll source tree and that Jekyll was constructing incorrect paths as a result, even though was set.  To confirm this, I manually extracted the built using into a directory and confirms that running correctly serves the site. Then," I cd-ed into the my local bazel-website source tree and then ran where  jekyll serve source source'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My initial reaction was the confusion would not be worth it.  But, as I have thought about it more, I realize it already does not work and users need to consult the documentation to learn the limitation.

You can convert into to check boxes (or submit and check.) If there is no need for certain fields like output and redirection, please delete those headers before submitting. We know not all tickets require those steps. Otherwise, please try to be as detailed as possible.  If you are unsure this is a bug in Jekyll, or this is a bug caused by a plugin that isn\\\'t directly related to Jekyll, or if this is just a generic usage question, please consider asking your question at url  where non-bug questions go.  Please make sure to mention an affinity team whose responsibilities most closely align with your issue.  Thanks! -[ ] I believe this to be a bug, not a question about using Jekyll.

In the event you are unsure, file a ticket, however, when you do please provide the logs (strip them of personal information.)  If you have trouble finding your logs, please email support@ and they will happily help you.

Such as the directories you created and, the full command you ran, and include any plugins you have installed, this is very important.  If your steps are complicated, you can also submit a GitHub repository (please no zips, they will be removed and rejected by maintainers,") and just supply a command for us to reproduce it ourselves. -## The Output I Wanted  <!-The install was great until I actually wanted to create the site. I could not find anything clearly saying ""this is how to start the site"" except for the small blurb on the home page.

Oh, sorry this is a bug with Ruby, go open an issue there.  Oh, sorry this is a bug with GCC, go open an issue there.  ...and so on.

Did you explore an in-memory LRU cache that you can commit to disk?  Updating your markdown converter  its settings should definitely invalidate the cache. Also if it used liquid, it may generate different markdown in different runs so make sure the cache key is liquid-agnostic (either by using the compiled liquid as the hash content, or by ensuring the cached html has the unrendered liquid in it).

It seems that it can, especially since Utterson is using a spinning disk backed EBS which has very limited I/O performance as you mention. Fortunately, Markdown converters don\\\'t need to know anything about Liquid. Since Jekyll processes Liquid before Markdown conversion, any change at the Liquid level would result in different raw Markdown. As you say," we are ""using the compiled liquid as the hash content"".

Each gets its own subfolder, with a few files using templates. One of the files generates a table of contents for that workshop," listing all the assets in it (say: ""Schedule""",Participants,"Registration""). But some assets should only show up if they are really present, e.g. ""Group photo"" should only be shown after a file has been added.  Of course in that case, I could just as well set a boolean in the top YAML of the index file which indicates whether to include the group photo or not. But this is easy to forget; and more so if you consider that this has to be done for several files. Anything that the computer can trivially do automatically removes a chance for errors.\''
