Yes", it\\\'s true," the container with all of it\\\'s full styles is not going to be duplicated. But that\\\'s not what OOCSS is really about. OOCSS abstracts certain characteristics of elements and reuses them in multiple places. So the container might have something like: &lt;div class=""container-main basic-border shadow rounded""&gt;. So in that example (which is very over-the-top for illustrative purposes)", the class .container-main would have some very rudimentary styles that apply only to the container, then the other class names would represent the reusable elements that might appear elsewhere. Of course," the same thing can be accomplished using: &lt;div id=""container"" class=""basic-border shadow rounded""&gt;. But why would you do that? What would be the point (from a CSS perspective) of using an ID of ""container""", which could cause problems with specificity and the cascade? When you use the class-only method, you avoid any possible specificity issues, and you encourage all developers to recognize the importance of abstracting common styles. And naturally, if someone wants to grab the container with JavaScript, then by all means," they can add id=""container"" any time they want. But that\\\'s optional", so it would seem less practical to include that and not the class, which is _definitely_ going to be used in the CSS.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

html5-boilerplate,203,closed,16,2010-11-18 16:26:49,2.73,,1,,b'b\' @joeybaker: I agree with one thing: The argument is at least half the fun. :) Regarding the container being non-duplicated: This really has nothing to do with removing the id from the container. I am in 100% agreement that the container is unique. This has to do with best practices in CSS. For example, which of the following two code snippets is more efficient? This one: #container {  margin: auto;  width: 60%;  box-shadow: #000 3px 2px 2px;  border: solid 1px #ccc;  min-height: 60%;}  Or this one: .container {  min-height: 60%;} .center-full {  margin: auto;  width: 60%;} .shadow-border {  box-shadow: #000 3px 2px 2px;  border: solid 1px #ccc;}  The answer is clear: The second one. The reason? Because the non-container styles can now be re-used. This is not to say that they definitely _will_ be reused, but this encourages the possibility of re-use, which is really what best practices are all about. You mentioned that you only do basic styling to the container. Well, that\\\'s why OOCSS should be used! :) Because those \\\'basic styles\\\' can be moved into a reusable module that you can \\\'call\\\' when you need them. Yes, it\\\'s true, the container is quite unique, but it has the potential to have reusable styles (like a  or something else). The point is that, for all practical purposes, .container is exactly the same as #container in your CSS, except for the fact that .container doesn\\\'t have the potential for specificity conflicts that #container does. And yes, you will sometimes need to grab the container using an ID. But that\\\'s not a requirement, so it shouldn\\\'t be there from the start. Especially if it discourages the best practice of abstracting common styles and making the CSS faster and more efficient. Finally," you said ""Ids are the simplest selector"". That\\\'s not really true. Is .container not just as simple? Also", as mentioned, the specificity problems can be troublesome. But again, those specificity problems don\\\'t exist with classes that abstract common styles. Well, this has somewhat turned into a debate on OOCSS, but in my opinion," changing id=""container"" to class=""container"" would go a long way to encouraging the better practice of writing reusable CSS. And hey", maybe the container isn\\\'t the right element to argue for OOCSS, but if .container is no different, then why not do that? What exactly is lost from using the class instead of the id? I think in some sense, many developers are clinging to the tired old habit of putting an ID on everything, but I\\\'m starting to sway in the other direction nowadays.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,
html5-boilerplate,203,closed,17,2010-11-18 16:26:49,23.15,,1,,b'b\' @impressivewebs: I can\\\'t tell if we\\\'ve wandered down a rat hole or not, but since we both agree the argument is worth having, if not just fun \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 You\\\'re points on OOCSS are of course valid, but you also lead into it\\\'s inherent weakness: classes that _might_ be used again. Classes that are used only once are likely wasteful and lead to code bloat. CSS should be optimized not for the developer who has to maintain the code base, nor the user who just wants a fast experience, but a practical mix of both.  With that in mind, classes like & may be used again, they may not be. If they\\\'re used again, they\\\'re worth abstracting into a class, but until then, your first example is actually more efficient \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\xc2\\xa0both for the dev and the user. That\\\'s the main problem with OOCSS \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this isn\\\'t server-side where additional code just makes the code base more verbose. Every character is a performance hit. Every additional class is a detriment to the user if it\\\'s not needed. Not for nothing," extra class can also really complicate your ""API"" \\xe2\\x80\\x93 I\\\'d have trouble remembering all the different options I\\\'d built for myself and duplicate functionality.

Don\\\'t get me wrong \\xe2\\x80\\x93\\xc2\\xa0I\\\'m not advocating styling a bunch of Id\\\'s separately each time \\xe2\\x80\\x93 that\\\'s also wasteful.

Even if you are going to clump all your styles into one block", the class is almost exactly the same, except for a very small performance benefit in favour of the id. But it seems that many are arguing that the small performance benefit to using an ID over a class is trumped by the potential problems of using IDs. Anyhow, this is not a huge deal to me, but I just can\\\'t see many reasons for leaving it as an ID, since an identical class would be almost exactly the same and would encourage what I believe is eventually going to be a universal best practice (that is, OOCSS).\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Looking at Nicole\'s examples on url  there is some abstraction between styles and class names. They are not as semantic as they could be, but for most style changes that I can think of the HTML wouldn\'t need to be modified too much.Although, overall it is a balancing act I guess on what kind of changes are expected as to how  from the underlying styles do you want class names. .shadow-border is great if you expect that (semantically distinct) elements will be changing whether they need shadow borders or not lots, but woeful if whatever .shadow-border is being used to highlight will be changed to different effects.Personally I am currently leaning towards a non-OO CSS style. OO CSS tends towards html bloat, where as non-OO CSS tends towards CSS bloat, however the CSS is going to be cached once off, where as HTML probably won\'t be cached at all (and the bloat comes with every page).Another consideration is that most people using H5BP (in my opinion) are building small to medium scale sites which would probably be suited to a more non-OO CSS style.Also, interestingly on slide 20 url  it states as a pitfall \'Avoid IDs to style inside the main content areas\', which suggests that using IDs on outer container elements is ok?I do like Necolas\' idea of not including anything in the body as I think it is hard to say this is the way to do it. However, I do like including the header and footer elements and the role attribute on the main div," as this will get people thinking about HTML5 markup and accessibility who otherwise may have stuck to a purely HTML4 oldschool style.I would be leaning towards as this gets people thinking about an HTML5 based design without proding them one way or the other in terms of OO CSS.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\\\'ve seen this resolved in very strange ways, using special classes or even Javascript to dynamically remove the border. I figured out a relatively easy fix via CSS: a img { vertical-align: middle; }. That should work fine with the overwhelming majority of cases. More info on what\\\'s happening: the vertical-align doesn\\\'t change where the image itself sits," just the ""text"" that\\\'s contained within it", i.e., the alt text. The method is not without limitations, however, as transparent images will still show the border behind the image. It also probably won\\\'t have the desired effect in cases where the image is smaller than the line height or font size, e.g., small smileys. It could be more easily resolved if a :has(element) pseudo-element were created, e.g., a:has(img) { border: 0 none; }, but in the absence of such simplicity, we\\\'re stuck with imperfect or less-than-desirable solutions.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In each of the three types of compression (-htmlclean," -htmlbuildkit and -htmlcompress) the type of the file is explicitly set as html.

I propose the following fix for this: url  which adds a second verification to check if the output from is really a directory.

html5-boilerplate,523,closed,body,2011-05-22 11:19:19,00:00,,,1,b'b\' I have my crazypants on today but I wanted to share this somewhat funny idea. This is definitely as a novelty idea more than anything else, but I\\\'m pretty sure you could implement the entire build process in the browser thus making it accessible to anyone with Firefox or Chrome. My thought process was coming at this from the angle of the large portion of people without control over their server environment, or perhaps the expertise. As someone said in another thread, the project doesn\\\'t necessarily need to cater to all comes in all respects, but it\\\'s nice when it\\\'s possible.### The easy stuff: javascript: uglifyjs url Removes development only js: Should be trivial to do with uglifyjs since you\\\'re already parsing the js css: url  probably othersPotentially use javascript implementation of SASS: url Minify html and update references: url  with some modifications for any html changes needed, it\\\'s already parsing the html.htaccess  is trivial### More complicated:Optimize pngs. This can definitely be done in the browser but full solutions don\\\'t exist. Read image data in using canvas. Convert to base64 PNG datauri: url  or url  Mix in optimizations from various PNG crunchers (try to palletize," LZMA url  Paeth filter etc.). Optimize jpegs. Starting point: Javascript jpeg encoder url  Would need to identify routes to implement optimization (aside from stripping metadata which is an easy win).Embed images as datauris: trivial at this point since we have the the  CSS and we have all images as datauris.### Tying it offCreate a zip file using url  which provides an easy to use interface for generating a zip with files and folders **(""css"").add("""""," ourMinifiedCss)**. We can generate the folder structure and filename changes as desired inside the zip file. Our modified code files are simply passed as text and images via base64 encoded datauris which the zip lib converts into the approriate files.The final output is a zip file which then has to either be downloaded from the browser (**=""data:;base64","+()**) and manually deployed to the server, or can be uploaded via AsyncRequest to some simple script on the server that clears the existing files and extracts the new zip (need some sort of authentication in this case since we\\\'re exposing the ability to modify the server). The big weak spot is image optimization. Two other options for those parts are 1.) utilizing libraries or functionality that Flash might provide, or 2.) using the various image optimization web services that expose APIs url  url  The latter is definitely viable and not difficult to implement, but doesn\\\'t provide optimization as good and may have sign up requirements.### Node crossover Obviously a node version of this would be easier to make. If the new build script was built in node, this shows we could most likely build a browser version that implemented most or all of the node version functionality while benefiting from reusable parts like manifests and any libraries that can run in the browser, while back-filling the rest with ""best available"" solutions.\''

Yesterday I decided to try updating my build script to the latest version, because it hadn\'t been updated since March. I immediately started getting the errors mentioned in this post. I can isolate the problems to the difference in the build script, because reverting my latest Git commit (consisting solely of replacing my old build files with the new ones and updating file paths) brings the build back to working perfectly again (using ant text at least).

html5-boilerplate,620,closed,15,2011-07-23 04:51:31,427.1,,1,,b'b\' @mathiasbynens.  Very good observations, and you are correct: this won\\\'t make any sense if your subdomains are mapped to different non-nested folders (in web-server slang: if your VirtualHosts point to different DocumentRoots). And the user cases I gave ( ,  ,  , etc), as you correctly noted, does\\\'t apply as examples to this request. _Shame on me..._ But then... I can think of, at least, one _very common_ case and it goes hand in hand with H5B goals on performance: to serve static assets from a subdomain," allowing the implementation of both parallel requests & cookieless subdomain trick. This ""trick"" doesn\\\'t necessarily need a ""complex"" web server setup", and the good thing is that it can be even done by non-tech-savvy users on  shared hosting environments, where users only have one public DocumentRoot (i.e. /public_html/) for their . Even in that common scenario, the trick can be applied in two flavors:The most simple setup is to define  as a _mirror domain_ for . Thus, static assets (js, css, images) are served from url {js,css,images} and saved into the webserver\\xe2\\x80\\x99s file system at //{js,css,images}.  Example: a  file can be accessed at url  (no benefit) or url  (parallel request  cookieless benefits).  This one doesn\\\'t even need the mapping of subdomains to folders, and it works with any folder nested iside the main website root dir.Even on many  hosting plans, users are able to map subdomains to folders (nested or not), thus, the trick can still be applied, with the extra benefit of having a bit shorter URLs to the asset (shorter than the above mirror domain solution).  Example: User maps  to //.  Then, a  file can be accessed at url  (no benefit) or url  (parallel request  cookieless benefits). Of course, if this can be done on  shared hosting setups, it can also be done on a better fashion if you have better control of your server setup (i.e. on a VPS). Thanks.\'',,,,,,,,,,

The problem with the build script, in the context of the above sentence, is that people don\\\'t really understand where or how to use it in a project sense.  For starters, multiple authors shouldn\\\'t be running the build script on a project. It should be run as part of a deployment process or as some other defined step in the project lifecycle (e.g., running a development build for local testing). The build script should be producing a single deliverable or output at a specified time. If multiple people are hitting it and somehow stepping on each others\\\' toes, it\\\'s being used in the wrong way. We use Ant on projects with dozens of engineers and it doesn\\\'t cause issues because we never, ever use it in a way that\\\'s exposed to other engineers. We build locally for testing and then build for testing on the server and for deployment.  Secondly, the trend of the build script has been away from getting people to dive into the , but to my mind, if you\\\'re not tweaking this build script to fit your own folder structure and just relying on the limited power of the properties files, then you\\\'re missing out.

If your build process works, then it works. There\\\'s no need to rewrite it just to get some incremental update from the source. \''

However, I feel the current behaviour, at least on the iPad2, isn\'t desirable. Even though I\'m viewing the screen in landscape with 1024px available to me, my site is zooming as if I were looking at it in portrait mode at 768px. But it\'s not only zooming the text and other CSS elements on the page, it\'s also blowing up graphics and as such they are blurry. It\'s forcing the page to bump down one media query breakpoint when it doesn\'t need to do so. So we have the options already discussed: Which forces a 768px site into 1024px of space when in landscape mode artificially zooming all elements on the page. Portrait mode works as expected. Or: Which displays the site correctly in both landscape and portrait, displaying the right media query breakpoint for both. Although if you rotate from landscape to portrait the site gets clipped on the left the width of the scrollbar and requires a pinch to get it to center correctly. You can\'t zoom in unfortunately. Or: Which displays the site correctly in both landscape and portrait, also displaying both media query breakpoints for both. Again, if you rotate from landscape to portrait the site gets clipped on the left and requires a pinch to center it. Rotating back from portrait to landscape, however," leaves the site zoomed way in and also requires a pinch to scale it down and recenter it (is this the bug that was previously discussed?). Or: Leave the viewport meta off completely and the site scales to fit the page in portrait and the media query breakpoint is not respected and does not trigger at all.

It\'s a technique I wrote", so I\'ll give you a balanced take on its advantage and drawbacks. So, the most lightweight way to work around this bug is to omit the parameter as they did in H5bp. While this will indeed prevent a page from scaling beyond the constraints of the viewport when changing to landscape in iOS, it, like all other known workarounds for this comes with some drawbacks that you might consider: Primarily, when changing to landscape orientation with ommitted, the portrait layout will simply zoom to match the landscape viewport width, rather than reflowing the layout to take advantage of the 300-or-so more pixels available in landscape. This is the behavior you\'ll see in h5pb today. While this does successfully prevent the cropped-layout issue that comes with using  , the behavior can be unexpected, especially if you\'re used to seeing how other devices commonly handle orientation changes, or if you\'ve used sites that disable user-scaling (as that happens to make a page reflow as you might expect, with the considerable drawback that, well, zooming doesn\'t work).  The real bug here (accepted by Apple years ago in their tracker) is this: any time user-scaling is enabled, iOS actually always zooms the page by a multiple of  , regardless of whether is used. On iPad, that\'s about a 130% zoom, and on iPhone I think its a little more than that; if you have any raster assets in your page \\xe2\\x80\\x93 images, logos," etc \\xe2\\x80\\x93 they\'ll likely get pixelated and a bit ugly.

I came across this issue on my first responsive project (only a few weeks ago) and misinterpreted what was going on.  So do be aware: I\'m not advocating any of the following", just perhaps shedding some light on how some developers new to RWD might interpret this situation. What I figured was that devices with retina displays (e.g. the iPad 3 and iPhone 4 I was testing on), were returning different width values for my media queries to compensate for their high pixel density. In other words, telling my media query that the screen was two thirds as wide (in pixels) as it actually is, so that readable text on a regular display doesn\'t shrink down to be unreadable on the retina display.  I worked around this percieved issue by querying higher pixel density displays and, within them, changing my overall font size, as well as loading larger background images and scaling them down with background-size, thus working around the fuzziness you see in images on these devices. Not an ideal solution, but it worked in the sense that it solved the problems I had right then and there... But now I see I completely misunderstood what was going on.  I\'ll definitely be thinking about this the next time I\'m working on a RWD project. I do think that in many cases it\'s worth rejigging a responsive design for higher pixel density displays," but I see now that this had nothing to do with the issue I was experiencing!""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So, how about: So that you\\\'re not saying to a landscape device that it should have its viewport width set to its portrait width. url  didn\\\'t test a viewport of just initial-scale, which I would have been very interested in. I\\\'ve tested this meta viewport in Android and iOS (though can\\\'t find my iOS test results just now, sorry), and it appears to do  what you would expect in both portrait and landscape, but I fully acknowledge I haven\\\'t done enough testing for it to be considered good (and it\\\'s late and now I\\\'m worried that it has the iOS bug anyway and I\\\'ve forgotten, but hey). But as it doesn\\\'t seem to have been considered," I thought I\\\'d mention it. url  does say: ""For example", if you set the scale to 1.0," Safari assumes the width is device-width in portrait and device-height in landscape orientation."" which is what you would want in terms of the default.\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Windows 7 and prior have 3 DPI settings targets: 96dpi (100%), 120dpi (125%) and 144dpi (150%).

Using X-UA-Compatible in either an HTTP header or a meta tag will get rid of the biscuit so users don\'t click it. It also overrides any listing in Microsoft\'s Compatibility View list, which companies might need to do if they\'re using H5BP to redesign a site that currently is on that list. They can\'t get Microsoft to take their site off the list until the migration is complete, but they need their new design to override the CV list. The absolute best way to avoid compat mode is for the site to send out the X-UA-Compatible HTTP header, because it avoids the need for IE to potentially restart a few lines down into the file when it sees the meta tag. However, a lot of companies have an organizational structure where the operations group that runs the server would never let some front-end Javascript jockeys tell them what headers they should send. So having a working X-UA-Compatible meta tag is the first line of defense. If the tag isn\'t going to help this IE situation, it should just be pulled out because devs are going to see it there, search for X-UA-Compatible, and think it\'s protecting them from compat mode," when it\'s not.

html5-boilerplate,1226,closed,2,2012-09-30 13:04:43,186.7,,,1,b'b\' Thank you @alrra for replying to my issue. Well i\\\'m not totally satisfied and i\\\'ll try to explain here : 1. If you have php5 module loaded," this won\\\'t make any change to integrate the ""php_flag"" or ""php_value"" directives inside the  condition2. If you use PHP5 as CGI", this will actualy fail and Apache will report the error i said above. I know you have to use another technique (like modifing the  file) to change the values, but the most important is that this will not fail. Why I\\\'m telling you this," is that i have some servers (localhost and other) with php5 module and some with PHP5 loaded with CGI (like cloud hosting services) but I don\\\'t want the php5 directives to make my same project fail and report the error in production. So moving the php directives into the  condition will fix the error failure (because ""php_flag"" and ""php_values"" depends on the php5_module). I think it\\\'s the same for the caching rules : if you don\\\'t have the module", you don\\\'t enjoy the caching rules but at least the rules won\\\'t make the project fail. Hope this is clearer and that it helps.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Serving all my scripts minified together with jQuery brought no noticeable speed increase over requesting Google\\\'s CDN jquery and my scripts separately2. Asynchronous loading, in turn, brought performance increase but3. Most popular async loaders, including Require JS with-bundled-jquery, HeadJS and LazyLoadJS broke my layout. I don\\\'t know why and after a few hours of debugging I decided to try Google JS API and 4. Google JS brought me the speed of async loading and didn\\\'t break my layout, but you depend on what version of jQuery will the API offer. In my case," when I request for version 1 (as in ""latest release from 1.x series"") Google sends you to 1.7.1. You can manually choose another one", but you\\\'ll have to cope with shorter cache headers. So yes, I agree with you in that the plain loading from Google CDN isn\\\'t the best approach, but I\\\'m throwing in my two cents: on a Linode VPS the overhead of serving jQuery myself is above any performance benefit, and instead I\\\'ll reccomend an async loader.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\\\'m just not sure that your example isn\\\'t unique to your specific setup as other testing has shown otherwise.  And aren\\\'t you making 2 requests then to load jQuery (for the Google code and then again for the jQuery code itself)?  Fine if you plan to utilize the Google Loader for other things, but probably not best standard practice. Also, as an aside," you should always request a specific version of jQuery rather than the 1.x ""latest""", because of 1) the potential for breakage following any breaking changes when your site gets auto-updated to the latest jQuery.  And 2) you also won\\\'t get a long lived cached version," which is one of the ""benefits"" being discussed here as regards loading scripts from the jQuery CDN using a standard script tag and a specific version.

If you\'re grabbing the latest version of jQuery from Google", many scripts could break without you even knowing it. That scenario is a sort of dependency hell we need to avoid. I am aware webmasters like to stick with one solid version of jQuery for peace of mind, like 1.8, or the even safer 1.4 variety to avoid the latest version of jQuery breaking our plugins, but... A single point of failure like Google\'s AJAX CDN could cause problems too: Call me extreme in my view," but aren\'t self-hosted solutions a more ethical approach to serving scripts? The independent approach has no caveats because you\'re in control of the server. If it goes down setup a new instance. Also you\'re not tracked by Google. How many times is your IP logged each time jQuery is served from Google\'s CDN? jQuery weighs in at little more than the size of a standard sized PNG file. So it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s equivalent to loading a small graphic. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s not the bloated monster many blog authors like to claim it is ;) Food for thought.

I agree with @stevesouders reasoning and just looking at the core numbers it\'s _generally_ a decent default. One of the things that I saw in my testing was that the variability of the server itself can be a big issue. The best results I\'ve seen with single  file solutions were on a box I\'ve got root access on which is running mod_pagespeed. With a generic server losing out on Google\'s optimized delivery itself can be an issue. So I think the code should stay where it is. That said", talking about the ways in which the default can be improved is impotant.

In my testing, DNS lookup for  takes about 75ms, less than half that of a \\\'normal\\\' (outside top 10k) domain. Chrome [does speculative DNS lookups]url  anyway, and other browsers are heading in the same direction, so this hostname lookup will almost never be on the critical path. It contributes to domain sharding (and does so in half the time), and it\\\'s cached state can always be ensured with a Link: rel=dns-prefetch HTTP header for those who always need the greatest speed. However the most critical thing is that individual jQuery versions never change. Once it\\\'s cached it will always be valid. A high max-age means no connection, no request, no 304 response, browsers even cache the result of parsing the JS so it doesn\\\'t need to be re-parsed. Your own website\\\'s JS will change much more frequently," and bundling the two together is almost **never** a benefit. The only people who would benefit are those who arrive with a cold cache. The target audiance is pertanent here. If the target audiance is ""everyone"""," and not ""high-paid front-end performance experts""", then the default should be what will work best in the general case. The experts can combine their JS if A/B testing proves it to be beneficial for them. General HTML authors using this boilerplate won\\\'t have the skills to do that. To the guy who commented saying a high cache churn rate would mean jQuery won\\\'t stick around in the cache, you\\\'re not thinking. A high churn rate means the user is visiting lots of sites. This means they are _more_ likely to have encountered at least one site which uses jQuery from the CDN, and they are _more_ likely to have seen several sites which use the same jQuery version. Repeated use from multiple sites will therefore make jQuery more likely to be present than someone with a low churn rate who is visiting your site for the first time.

I wonder if there is a way to track a segment of users and see how many times over the course of the day a they use the same version of jQuery between sites. It\\\'s possible user behavior could select for sites that have a smaller subset of jQuery versions (I\\\'m a designer and I visit a lot of elitist web design blogs?), and I personally work on a small ecosystem of apps that can benefit from pulling the same version of jQuery between sites. And then there\\\'s cache lifetime: the longer a user\\\'s cache lives, the more likely they are to have a particular jQuery in their cache. How long does an average internet user need to surf until they have 80% of jQuery versions somewhere in their cache? The likeliness of a particular version being available is a curve that increases over time. Thanks for pointing out the numbers again," and I completely agree that it\\\'s a lottery.

If you are the web dev for a network of sites that link together perhaps that can help.  But if you\\\'re that big, you should really look into a caching CDN (eg + uses CloudFlare).Again, out of scope for this project.

I think the lowercase doctype is consistent with the lower-case of the html tags used. Beyond consistency, uppercase is loud, obnoxious and isn\'t a calm introduction into the HTML source. Google uses the lowercase doctype," along with hundreds of thousands of sites built with earlier h5bp versions. ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you want to be super clear about the terms under which your code is licensed for reproduction and distribution, then you should include the _entire_ license in your code. Short of that, however, providing a URL to the license within the code is probably sufficient as far as I know. The reason there is a lack of certainty is because these licenses and these methods of licensing haven\'t been well tested within the courts. It\'s important to note that the distribution of the license is to protect _other developers_ who use the code, not the copyright holder. Copyright holders are protected regardless of whether the licensing information is included. If no licensing information is included, the courts would automatically assume that the code has not been licensed for copying or distribution, and the onus would be on third parties to demonstrate that they received permission to reproduce the copyrighted work.""'

You may know that information is not copyrightable", the copyright applying to the expression of that information, so that if person A supplied information in year 1 that persons B and C expressed in a style sheet or style sheet template in years 2 and 3, the notice would state only years 2 and 3 and only persons B and C. The need for a notice, the general form it takes," and that ""MIT Notice"" does not come close to resembling a copyright notice are so widely known among the general public that the first respondent\\\'s request for further research appeared to be a request for a deep briefing based on statutory and case law", which would have taken a few hours to assemble and write, which is partly why I didn\\\'t reply to the first answer. Most books I\\\'ve ever seen on how to copyright a work or on the law of copyright, written for either authors or attorneys, say pretty much the same thing on point. It appears that most major software companies rely on Federal statutory copyright law and publish notice reserving their copyright claims. Because of the public knowledge of notice and its form," an omission of notice would presumably be intentional. The phrase ""MIT License"" is informative mostly to those of us geeks who know something about it. No law is likely to support using the unaccompanied phrase as legal notice of copyright. In this context", it could mean that the *.css file saying it was obtained under the MIT license, without implying anything about the next user. Unless the license itself had said otherwise, there\\\'s no legal need to reproduce the entire license in a *.css file. You needn\\\'t say anything unless you want people to know about it. You presumably want people to know the *.css files are copyrighted even if they discover the files outside of your zipped file, so you need a copyright notice in each *.css file. It should be placed where it\\\'s most likely to give notice to a reader, so it should be near the top of each *.css file. Whether, how," and where to tell a file\\\'s readers how to get any kind of permission under that copyright is at your editorial discretion. Phrasing like ""Use", copying, modification," . . . are permitted under the MIT License ([URL])."" is likely sufficient. You could even say just ""For permissions under the copyright"," see the MIT License ([URL])."" The form last proposed in this thread would be legally sufficient; it\\\'s up to you whether it would suffice for purposes of encouraging reuse and development of the *.css files. The license itself", as you supply it in the *.zip file, has a copyright notice, but, because of where it appears and what it says, it applies only to the license itself, not to any *.css files, and the license file would normally not be installed on a user\\\'s website. (The license was probably written for files where the normal exposure was different than is the case with *.css files in the wild.) Also, the license file does not mention MIT and the copyright notice says that HTML5 Boilerplate owns the copyright on the license, unlikely but not impossible (your arrangement or enhancement might be under your copyright) but is not indicative of an MIT interest. If your copyright is only in enhancement and arrangement and not in the substantive expression because someone else (I guess MIT) has the copyright in the latter, your copyright notice overclaims, and you\\\'re generally not allowed to overclaim, after allowing for reasonable disagreement about what is yours and what is another party\\\'s. To prevent overclaiming," this phrasing will work: ""Portions copyright [year] [creator\\\'s name (perhaps yours)]"". Please let me know what copyright notice to add on your behalf to the *.css files I install from your set. Thank you.\''",

html5-boilerplate,1913,closed,9,2016-12-31 00:48:01,222.95,,,1,"b'b"" @ArmorDarks Even though I like the Standard style", I don\'t think it\'s good to enforce others to follow it. Especially developers without much knowledge or experience, as their code may lead to unexpected runtime errors and cause further problems, even leading to increased number of issues for the project.  As much as I like programming language\'s flexibility, such perk comes at a price, and the question is if we\'re willing to pay that price. Stricter rules almost always make the code easier to understand and more reliable as a consequence, even as the project grows.  Moreover, semicolons win by popularity, taking Airbnb\'s JavaScript style guide as an example: one of the most starred repositories on GitHub and higher download numbers on NPM.[1][2][3][4]  Also, we would need to update all JavaScript files, as they\'re all using semicolons already.[5][6]  Therefore," I don\'t believe this subject worth the [bikeshedding]url ### References: [1] url  [2] url  [3] url  [4] url  [5] url  [6] url ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

That includes blowing away the existing rules we have in place wholesale without at least a discussion of what new rules should be (which is why the existing PR for eslint is DOA.) I will die on the hill of semicolons", for example.  As a note: the actual consumers of the ruleset is limited to the maintainers and anyone who is conscientiously creating PRs and actually testing their code. We won\'t ship an in the dist.

But you ship the JS code, which will be included in other projects, which will later be linted, and people will be forced or to edit it to fit their rules, or to use HTML5Boilerplate rules. That\'s why JS should be as close to JS community standards as possible, and I think that making some necessary changes to rules and codestyle is unavoidable.
