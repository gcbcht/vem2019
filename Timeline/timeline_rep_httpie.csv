That is, the specificity affects the media type, so a more specific subtype sets precedence over a similarly typed media range. However, once the specificity resolves media types, they are ordered according to quality scores. I believe that this part of the RFC is ambiguous to readers.  In this interpretation, when a server has an internal preference of serving over  , httpie, in JSON mode, is telling the server it has no preference of which media type to respond with (because both media type quality scores are 1.0). This causes non-obvious media type choices when using httpie. Perhaps it helps to see what some browsers set in their headers:  url In that link, Internet Explorer and Edge are the only two browsers that don\'t specify a quality score for media ranges.  You can see this in the Apache documents:  url Apache understands the intention of clients to have be a lower quality score, and thus set that internally  . However, there are servers in the wild that do not follow this interpretation. Thus, it is desirable for httpie to be explicit," and set a quality score that is lower than 1.0 for the wildcard when operating in JSON mode.""'",,,,,,,
