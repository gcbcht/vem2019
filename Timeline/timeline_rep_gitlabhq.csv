Added API endpoints for POST (Create) and DELETE (Delete", duh.) of branchand tag resources. It takes advantage using Sidekiq to throw the actionsinto a background process as Gitlab does for many other actions; howeverGitlab is setup to cache the branches and tags So we need to expire the cache.There\'s a nice existing expire_cache method in the repository model to do this. We can run into an issue with race conditions in which the expire_cache would be called_before_ the branch was created, rendering it moot But (Would need to double check this)I believe many other actions expire the cache anyhow So on any active project itwould be updated soon anyhow. I originally thought about passing along the repositoryobject into Sidekiq but this caused Redis to lock up entirely and until I flushed all keysit wouldn\'t run any sidekiq jobs, even if I cleared them. This is a very useful feature as personally I integrate with Gitlab and would like to createtags and branches upon different actions when deploying to various environments (Deploy to staging -Create a release candidate branch," deploy to prod Create a tag) See GitHub\'s API for a reference as they support a similar setup: url  Let me know if there is anything that could be improved!""'",,,,,,,,,,,,

Make the appropriate changes again.2.  3.  . Run and see that your commit is there.4. (this runs rebase on your two latest commits)5. Replace with on the commit of step 3, save and exit.6. A new editor will appear. Remove the second commit message, save and exit.7. Run again and see that you latest commit is gone, or rather squashed into the previous one.8.  9. Congratulations you learned basic rebase! :dancers:  A few notes:1. When contributing to a project it\'s better to run your changes in a different branch.2. and rebase in general is highly NOT recommended if others have already pulled your previous commits, as it rewrites history. It\'s cool in these cases where you submit a patch and others can do code review ;) So now," please open it again and retry! We\'ll be here if anything goes wrong.

On my system the gitlab-shell dir is group writeable. Because git is owner and group there is no problem with it from gitlabs point of view but logrotate thinks different. The patch above only resolves the problem for the log files within the  directory. But the error is still present for the gitlab-shell logfile. The only way to solve it would be to change the dir permission of the gitlab-shell dir (g-w) or to create a subdir gitlaband set those permission correct. Or am I wrong...?'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

So what about [fa-cog]url  ?![gitlab_icons_cog]url  In my opinion, I think fa-cog is the better rendering for binaries. But, well, doesn\'t really look like a file... Two possible options:Use fa-stack method for custom file icon as explained [here]url  but I have to change the template code for this and this will force you to use file-icon in any way.Integrate [Github octicons]url  which has [binary]url  and [symlink]url  icons.
