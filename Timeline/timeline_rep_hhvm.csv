Currently that is the only game in town, so virtualy all existing packages, libraries, frameworks etc, which are a large and fast growing body of code, expects to interact with mongo using the same classes and interfaces. This is analogous to the mysql interface in hhvm, adding a non php complient mysql interface to hhvm would have been a non-starter, and would have significantly impacted takeup. Mongodb is now in the same position.

hhvm,900,closed,1,2013-07-27 07:06:34,895.95,,1,,"b'b"" This was asked on StackOverflow recently", possibly by you -either way, reposting the answer from there: HHVM engineer here. In server mode, HHVM will run the first N requests it sees in interpreter-only mode (i.e. with the JIT off). The default in an optimized build is N=11, so if you were to run the request 12 times, the 12th one would be much faster. You can tune this with a config option, like so: -v =3. If you set it to 0, you\'ll see the speedup immediately. There are a couple reasons to do this. First, it prevents transient warmup effects from affecting JIT-compiled code. For example, the first few requests may need populate values in APC, which will cause the application code to go down different paths from the steady-state paths. This way, we don\'t waste space on JIT compilations that will only be used a few times. Second, it allows HHVM to collect profiling information to improve future compilation. If we observe that a certain value is an integer 99% of the time, for example, we can compile code that\'s optimized for the integer case. We currently don\'t have the facility to JIT-compile code with profiling enabled (the hard part is safely throwing it away once we\'re done with it)," so we do the data collection in interpreter-only mode.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I installed hhvm and put my web-project source in / and then I ran hhvm in server mode from that directory. And I am really feeling excited as most of the things are working. This particular issue is also solved if I use curl instead of file_get_contents.

I used instructions given at url  and I am using cenos-6.4. When I ran gdb it showed that it collected gdb symbols for hhvm so I presume that it was debug build. But gdb could not collect debug symbols for many other dependencies. I did like this. First started hhvm and then attached gdb using pid and then browsed from browser. I have noticed following scenarios when I browse:a. When gdb is attached it just hangs. I am not sure if create stack-trace in /tmp folder in this case. I will get back to you on this.b. When gdb is not attached, it creates a stack-trace in /tmp folder. But hhvm process looks like hanging and unable to process any other request. c. When I put \'@\' (waring suppressor) before file_get_contents. It creates a stack-trace in /tmp folder and hhvm process terminates with message segmentation fault.Sure. Tomorrow, I will be on it.

hhvm,1312,closed,3,2013-11-29 01:05:20,362.83,1,,,"b'b"" The behaviour described in #384 is not _quite_ accurate. Looking at the Zend implementation", it uses a guard for the property name on the object, but has flags for whether it\'s in a set,get,isset etc all separately. This means that setting a property from within a will still call  , it only prevents infinite recursion, so each magic property method is treated separately. Otherwise, the triviality of it depends on whether adding another field to is acceptable or not. I do understand that is a very performance critical piece of code, so it may very well be unacceptable, in which case the solution is much more complex. Unfortunately, there is code that relies on the ability to use magic property methods from within an existing magic property call," though I haven\'t seen any that rely on the fact that from within a magic method has different behaviour than outside of it.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ZEND PHP tries to prevent infinite recursion by returning null for __get when it is called for the SAME property again from __get method. Infinite recursion is a bug in any case and just returning wrong result in this case is a bad option actually. Would be much better to let it run out of stack and give error than to hide it and return a wrong result as ZEND PHP does right now. So why not just enable the recursive __get without any limitations? Cant really see any code that would fail in this case that is not already failing now (where now recursive __get is disabled alltogether). I think that recursive __get and __set are a big part of PHP and much code depends on it (atleast our code does). And some libraries just wont run under hhvm. If limitless recursive __get would give someone a probem, then it is very easy do add recursion blocker in their __get method," whereis currenty we would need to rewrite entire libraries.  So any reason why not just enable the recursive __get without any limitations (should be better than current solution )?'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Actually it might not be too hard to write into HHVM. The __anti_loop array can be first initialized when first recursion occurs. It would look perhaps something like this: Right now HHVM is keeping track if the execution is inside a magick method and refuses to call another magick method. Instead of refusing it should just call another function lets say ""__get_from_inside_a_magick_method"" that initialyzes the anti loop functionality. It could actually be a static internal HHVM C method (my PHP code is just for illustration for the idea) That would mean that as long as a magick method is not used recursivly the code would run exactly as fast as right now and use same amount of memory. The recursive magick method calls would be a bit slower and require more memory however it so much better than not having the feature at all. Seems to me an easy solution. Or what do others think?

hhvm,1706,closed,23,2014-02-04 17:47:53,1337.68,,1,,b'b\' I can confirm this problem.We have been running HHVM in production environment for about a year now. We are mostly running Magento sites. Our setup varies, we have servers running nginx / hhvm and lighttpd / hhvm. All of them use fastcgi and Ubuntu server 14.04. The error occurs on both lighttpd and nginx.It is not connected to a specific HHVM version. We have seen this error since we started using HHVM (don\\\'t remember the version) a year ago until the latest version," 3.10.1. I have only seen this error occur on forms using the enctype=""-data"" property. In Magento there are some pages that first sends the data as an url encoded post (via ajax", for validation) and then sends the same data as -data for saving. The error never occurs on the first post (url encoded). I have only seen the duplicate data on checkbox and multiselect inputs, which all have in common that their name ends with [], like or  . It seems like the process environment on the server is affecting the error (race condition?, cache problem?). It comes and goes, it happens on one server but not the other. Upgrading, restarting sometimes makes it go away, sometimes makes it come back.However, once it is there, it is quite persistent until you restart or upgrade something. Also changing the form data can affect it. We are using this workaround in Magento:If the problem occurs, select a different option, save, select the correct option and save again. It works most of the time. I hope this helps.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I am now attempting to add FastCGI tests for PHP, HHVM and Zephir. The [code is available]url  in the fcgi branch on GitHub. Essentially I have created a HHVM extension, PHP and Hack version of the same Mandelbrot set generating code (see on GitHub project). For each of them I setup ( ) a HHVM FastCGI server, warm it up by making a few requests against it and then benchmark with a number of runs (20 in these tests). The FastCGI request is handled by a C++ FastCGI CLI client (  git submodule). It works fine with Mandelbrot sets of 100x100 and 200x200, but as soon as it is ramped up to 1,000x1,000 it randomly hangs during one of the 20 iterations for HHVM running PHP, Hack or via the HHVM extension. Sometimes it makes it as far as iteration 17 or 18, but normally it hangs after under 10 iterations. When I ask it to do a set of 2,000x2,000 it fails to complete one iteration. Unfortunately nothing is written to the HHVM logs either and it just silently hangs. If I kill the job and try to re-run it without stopping and starting the server it hangs without executing anything. So it is leaving the server in a failed state, but not causing the server to crash or die. I have tried changing a number of config options see the related issue on my project: url  Incidentally the PHP scripts using PHP\'s and Zend OPcache take longer to run, but they complete successfully every time (for sets 1000x1000, 2000x2000 and 5000x5000) so I am pretty sure it isn\'t something in my client implementation, but something in HHVM itself you never know though of course! The same test runs fine via HHVM on the CLI as well, but not via FastCGI. So this could be caused by a configuration issue or by something in HHVM itself I have no idea," but I would like to get it working so any help appreciated. I am just gonna ping @ptarjan here as from my previous ticket I believe this maybe your area of HHVM development.

hhvm,2123,closed,6,2014-03-21 00:11:03,67.1,,1,,b'b\' Thanks for the report! I can repro this, and it looks like a legit bug. Here\\\'s an explanation of why this happens:works by literally deleting statements out of the named AST -anything until the end of the block.We flatten blocks during naming, so the following two end up being the same:  This means that your gets clipped out by the  .We determine whether a function is a generator or not by the presence of any statement in the function body. But since the clipped out the  , we don\\\'t see it anymore.That means we don\\\'t think this is a generator -we don\\\'t see any return or yield at all, and so we think it implicitly is  .If you stick an at the top level of the function (can be the last statement if you want), we\\\'ll skip our return type annotation check," so this will be fine. But the check for ""is there an  "" only checks at top level", in order to enforce as much as we can about the function. Figuring out what the right thing to do here is somewhat complicated and unclear -all of these decisions make sense in isolation, they just don\\\'t work together :) IMO not requiring a keyword (like we do for  , which is why this doesn\\\'t happen there) was a serious error way back in the day. My suspicion of the right way to fix this is to make a new type of function, next to and  , that we can compute on the full AST or on the NAST before clipping happens. But the whole mechanism for causes other issues, so we may revisit that too. That said, I\\\'m not sure this is hi-pri enough for us to get to any time soon. If you\\\'re going to take a crack at fixing it yourself, let me know, and I can discuss and verify that the approach I say above is an acceptable one for us (before you spend a ton of work on it).\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Mysqlnd contains over 20000 lines of code. That we would need to get to run inside HHVM. And if we used mysqlnd I wouldn\'t be surprised if things would be slower. And my reasoning for that is that mysqlnd internally uses the same structures as PHP so everything would need to get converted from PHP structures to HHVM structures. With that said.

But by that point we\'ve lost that we\'re expanding because it was part of  , and yell. Ideally we\'d do the circularity check once, instead of every time we expand, and then write a into the declaration heap if things fail. The problem is there\'s not a good time to do this -we could make it happen after naming but before declaration, but those two happen together; there\'s no guarantee that naming of will happen before even declaration of  . I think the solution is to do what we do for the circularity check on classes, which run into a lot of the same issues. Before declaring  , we\'d go and declare  , etc etc. We can do the circularity check as part of this, just like we do with classes.

hhvm,2573,closed,body,2014-04-30 17:07:08,00:00,,,1,"b'b\' Bison 3.0 was released with Ubuntu 14.04 and is also included in other rolling distributions that people frequently use for development (e.g. Debian jessie). Regenerating the parser with "" parser"" fails in the following ways:Line spacing has changed"," so the seds fail. Changing the three sed calls to have ""\\\\s+"" instead of spaces fixes this (I have a patch for this at the Debian repository", but no CLA yet, so this description is probably okay...) (this is deprecated, but seems to work so far, so not as important)Finally, the more important one that my lack of good bison & HHVM internals knowledge hasn\\\'t allowed me to fix. After regenerating the source, the build output fails with: If you don\\\'t have bison3 handy, I\\\'d be happy to provide the bison output here.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You can now use composer  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c-dev\\xe2\\x80\\x9d : \\xe2\\x80\\x9c~3.1\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to get the latest stable Smarty version and its corresponding PHPUnit tests. Smarty-dev  contains just a wrapper t load the versions from \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9c-phpunit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. I hope this does work for you. The failures you will get when running the unit test should all be caused by the reported issue url  Besides that have not experience other problems.

hhvm,3797,closed,23,2014-09-20 05:42:42,13.22,,,1,"b""b' Hi guys", Essentially, the problem here does lie with HHVM. For some reason HHVM 3.3.0 requires that you explicitly state which configuration files to use (e.g.  ). This will fix a lot of PHP commands if you have the required config value in to enable loading XML over other streams again (i.e. file, http). This solution alone however is not enough with Symfony. For instance, when you run composer install / update and the postscripts are run, it calls php (or HHVM in this case) internally this time without the explicit configuration file setting being set.  This happens somewhere in a file called . For the project I was using this on, I simply extended that class, and added some additional logic to always call HHVM with the config variable set. Then placed that in my  so it would run in stead of the default one. I hope this points some of you in the right direction at least. (The alternative is to just use HHVM 3.4.0 the nightly build," this may not be possible for some people though!).'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You are passing number 0, which is not a reference. So you can try: Both hhvm 3.3 and 3.4 work. Part 2 If I only correct $data but not $fields, for example  ," I get ""\\\\nWarning: Argument 1 not passed as reference in \\\\xe8\\\\x95E-m\\\\x7f on line 0"". I get different file names and corrupted results from var_dump() in different runs. After this", all other php files will have corruption and return various errors. When using  , hhvm crashes in serialize(). However, hhvm shouldn\\\'t crash. Adding some checks about if the variable has the correct type in  to stop executing the function from reflection or in ext_ (line 129) can prevent from toInt64Helper() crashing and corruption. Part 3 If I change the lines to to remove the reflection and use the normal way to call bind_param(), hhvm 3.4 will not show any results. hhvm 3.3 is fine. I did a bisecting and found that url  caused the problem. I didn\\\'t see any leak with extraArgs without this commit. My understanding is that bind_param_helper() in ext_ stores all the arguments in a vector and calls arReturn() at the end. The reference variables are freed in arReturn() due to this commit, so update_result() in mysql_ can\\\'t set the result later ( ). Part 4: Memory leak Since that commit was about fixing memory leak, I reverted that commit and did a stress test. I found that the memory leaked so fast that somewhere else must be leaking. jemalloc profiling dumps showed MySQLStmt::bind_result() leaked. It turned out that ~MySQLStmt() and ~MySQLStmtVariables() were never called. The buffer will also leak if the result has strings. Every time hhvm runs your scripts above, it will be gradually leaking memory (about 1 requests in my testing).\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

hhvm,5528,closed,4,2015-06-24 08:24:41,646.45,,1,,b'b\' Hi, well, that\\\'s interesting. ini_set is used: error_log is watched with swatch, but, in production, where those crashes happen,  is always empty, since errors only occur in dev-env when making typos :-) The thing is, the app has a frontend and a backend. Frontend running on hhvm just crashes once, maybe twice a day, somedays not at all. I tried pen-testing dev-env, but no luck reproducing this. Setup is exactly the same, the only variable missing is user-(mis)behaviour.When switching the backend (huge amount of AJAX requests, ariadb writes) from php-cgi (no problems at all) to hhvm, hhvm crashes quite more often. But, it got better with each release of hhvm, < 3.7.0 it wasn\\\'t usuable at all with backend, since 3.7.0 I at least can try it for a few days before switching back to php-cgi when users start complaining about 502 ;)   file-systems related: Any ideas for ini tweaks or reproducing crashes?  seem quite useless to simulate user behaviour. //Edit:I currently have  and When I think about why backend crashes more likely than frontend, this _might_ be related: in frontend, MariaDB qps is insignificantly low, since most of the data is stored indefinitely in redis until a change in a dataset is made in backend, while backend has a high qps. For a few month now, starting with mariadb 10.0.x,  cronjobs mark random tables as crashed," as it cannot create a tmp table (this relates to the latest mysqlatfacebook rant about ""sheer incompetence""", mysql bug #77439), because it already exists (created by well ordered queries running at the same time). This happens on _all_ machines running hhvm with . Never reported that though, because: unreproducible.\'',,,,,,,,
hhvm,5528,closed,5,2015-06-24 08:24:41,82.93,,1,,b'b\' Hi again, I was able to pinpoint this to mPDF Library (mpdf1.com, v6.0, unrelated to previous mPDF issues), which explains why HHVM crashed more often on backend (heavy usage of mpdf). To be fair, this affects < 0,1% of all mPDF requests, but this makes it even harder to understand. The URL in stacktrace don\\\'t seem mean anything, it looks more likely to be related to another client that was trying to connect to HHVM through nginx  HHVM crashes.  At first, I set the mPDF timeout from 480s (?!) to 30s, so I could sleep again. Then I went through all related log files. One entry in HHVM  showed that mPDF was not able to load a 300dpi (~150k) image from a CDN host (resolver timeout), so I wondered if there are  issues with getaddrinfo(), since I\\\'m on debian testing with hhvm 3.7.2 for jessie, and added the CDN hosts to / (nsswitch preferes files before dns). _That_ didn\\\'t happen again, but the issues remains (but never with php-cgi up to 5.6.9)   and the stacktrace for above: When I restart HHVM as it becomes unresponsive, and before script times out, the stacktrace will be empty after DebuggerCount.  What I don\\\'t understand: Regardless of yet unknown mPDF code issues, if _one_ client is locking up HHVM with a mPDF request, why are all other requests to HHVM through nginx being stalled (and 503\\\'ed after timeout)? Shouldn\\\'t HHVM be threaded," and should not only the one ""spawned"" thread running the script crashing? Did I miss something in ?\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pecl extension using jsonc does not implement this properly either (for 8 byte longs," and is even more messed up for 4 byte longs since it only has the correct behavior for numbers not overflowing a 8 byte int). url We should probably disable this test when running under jsonc.
