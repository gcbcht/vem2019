Then I tried running the command line tool with and could get this [stacktrace]url  Its not able to compile sass files when they are changed. The version of compass I am using is 0.11.5 (also tried with 0.11.4). I was not able to test it with a different version of chunky_png as the dependency restricts it to use with chunky_png v1.2.0.

compass,614,closed,9,2011-11-09 21:00:19,1410.07,,1,,"b'b\' I\\\'m here just to comment and validate this as being a seriously confusing issue. The documentation doesn\\\'t mention anything about repeat-x being an ""image generation value"" opposed to a ""CSS value"". Since repeat-x is a CSS property", it is only natural to assume you\\\'re setting the CSS value. Add that on top of all of the sprite customization options varying back and forth between being options for image generation and css properties, it is beyond confusing. A real obstacle and turn-off to anybody trying to start using Compass. My suggestion would be to:1st) Fix the documentation. Separate image manipulation customizations from css customizations. Or at least make it clear what each does.2nd) Make the code smarter. If you\\\'re using repeat-x on image manipulation, I\\\'m inclined to believe repeat-x should also be on set on the CSS the majority of the time. If somebody has a case that\\\'s an exception to that, it makes more sense for them to override the typical scenario. Similarly, add another variable to control the CSS value.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Although it may be something we want to support at a more basic level", if possible. The current solution is a bit bulky. Mine follows the compass standard on experimental support, where Zee works around that. That\\\'s an interesting discussion topic for how we want to handle prefix support across compass, but we shouldn\\\'t apply it to this one module alone. I also included all of  as an optional include but that should probably remain a plugin rather than moving to core.  The other complaint about mine is the indented syntax, which I used only because interpolation wasn\\\'t supported in scss and I wanted to keep things consistent. It\\\'s a moot point, as either solution should port entirely to scss for inclusion.  So: I recommend combining the two.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Install latest Compass:  .3. In your Gruntfile or Gulpfile, add to the Compass block.4. In the Autoprefixer block," add  .5. Rewrite to local path  .

A positive value draws a shadow that is offset to the right of the box", a negative length to the left. **2nd length:** Specifies the vertical offset of the shadow. A positive value offsets the shadow down," a negative one up. This is why it looks like a 5px border bottom.
