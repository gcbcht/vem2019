The logic requires that the model structure be passed to the _isRequiredField function.  When the function loops through validateProperties, the new logic looks for the key.  If it is set, and the model structure is passed, then it checks to see if the current request has an id.  It uses the key and the request model id to determine if the rule is valid or not. In my testing, this worked.  I cannot think of a circumstance where the action would be update and there would be no primary key in the request data.

In fact, it even works properly as I have listed above except when you have only one element in the array.  The issue, per the tickets that I referenced, only happens when there is one element -but works fine when there are more than one in the array.  This fix doesn\\\'t change the handling of arrays as you state, but rather fixes the improper SQL that is generated from a 1 element array.  Given that this syntax works in those other cases," is it an unintended ""feature""  workaround or is the plan to build in support to use NOT as I have above (and other users have such as those that reported those tickets).\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And errors could probably be replaced with exceptions," as they are generally used when operations fail.

There are quite a few situations when a single function call performs operation on multiple folders where the operation can succeed on some and fail on others. Currently it just adds an error to the stack in case of a problem and continues to the next folder. So if we switch to exceptions the execution would just break off at that point which would not always be desirable. So perhaps this needs to be discussed a bit on how to deal with this in 3.0 As for now I think the changes made by dereuromark in the lastest commit to reset the lists by default when calling errros() and messages() should suffice and can be included in 2.3.'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

As applications become more reliant on JavaScript and XHR, managing onetime use tokens becomes painful. Using a CSRF token that is shared per session is the default in many other frameworks like Django and Rails, and I see no reason why it shouldn\'t be our default as well.#### Tokens stored in COOKIE The new tokens should preferably be stored in a COOKIE, this makes checking them simpler as developers don\'t need the additional dependency of starting a session to verify them.#### Accept X-CSRF-Token header In addition to accepting csrftokens via request body data," it would be good to allow csrftokens to be submitted via a header field.

cakephp,2223,closed,body,2013-10-29 00:43:14,00:00,1,,,b'b\' Currently, the new 2.x query strings can actually be both array and string. For pagination for example, they are usually string (direction, sort, page, limit, ...).But, if someone knows the Cake-way of forming query strings as array, he can easily make the application behave strangely, as most developers are not aware that the expected strings they are working with internally, can all of the sudden also be arrays.Best case: Lots of warnings and notices thrown.Worst case: Totally different and unexpected results. In my case, though," there was a faulty external JS that just appended ""page:2"" (named param) etc all the time"," thus creating thousands of lines in the error log this way:E.g. Same is possible using an array directly (usually not possible without some malicious intend): But seeing passed params as a thing that will soon be gone anyway my main concern is regarding the ""new "" query It is already bad enough that PHP internally is not very type safe and we need to be careful how to treat variables. That we can manage", though.But when data is coming from outside and from untrusty sources (in this case a faulty JS script, a  engine or even a user with malicious intend) we should be better safe than sorry. Example of an implementation that is sure widely used: Ok, the example is not dangerous, but I bet there are other uses cases where that adjective would be suitable. And here what it would currently need quite the overhead: In this case restricting all query strings to scalar values would be the way to go.Specific query strings can be whitelisted to be allowed either array only or even both.If a querystring behaves incorrect," it should throw an Exception and end up as 404. It would need to be part of the request object as this is mainly responsible for handling the data input.We could use a similar syntax as Auth and ALL key to set default values controller-wide and then can  specific query string types (whitelisting). For easy transition and BC I recommend to set the default to ""both"" right now in 2.5.It is fairly easy to overwrite the default then via AppController if desired (e.g. if some app exclusively uses strings here that would be a quick fix). And ideas on a more concrete implementation so far? I would love to see that going into the next minor release as part of an important step to restrict manipulation or triggering of wild behavior in Cake apps via query strings.\''",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Now, the string templates are a great ideea, looking forward to use them. But as @ravage84  said, the implementation must be done right. So I was thinking a interface that\'s designed to render the form. Something like JsHelper has. This way the user can write his own  or extend the existing ones. Also maintaining the way FormHelper is used atm. not sure if specific classes should be forced or not. again, i know i\'m adding more options and make it more complicated. but it\'s an important part of the framework and also an important part of any website, so the focus should be on flexibility.so:using string templates and  find a smart way to implement themimplmenting interfaces to render the form.keeping it simple but at the same time flexible. maybe RISC design will help. this way extending will be much easier. also:remove the use of $this->data for form," maybe a method like $this->Form->setData($user). i think it will be simpler on the controller logic.add posibility to do client side validationuse html5 date input. or give the user the ability to choose between cake\'s date input and html5\'s one.add posibility to have multiple forms for the same model on the same page. maybe something like  I know that this will that this will complicate the helper even more.

You can see it in action in the paginator helper. I think it and the ability to replace or add custom widgets will allow developers the flexibility they need.

But for another reason: In a client project where the client wanted to display an insane amount of form inputs on the same page the form helper has turned out to be horrible slow. The whole page took ~3.5 sec to render AFAIR and 1/3 of the time was caused by the form helper alone. To disable the security component made it interestingly a lot faster the reason for that is some excessive use of one of the Hash class methods and the attribute building.

Using plain objects and delegating the table responsibilities to another class is better for sharing code. With that said," and if you want this to happen you could build the ActiveRecord layer.

cakephp,3325,closed,title,2014-04-15 02:03:50,00:00,,1,,"b""b' 3.0 Console improvements'""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cakephp,3325,closed,body,2014-04-15 02:03:50,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" The cake console has been iteratively improved in each of the major CakePHP releases. There are still a few opportunities to improve the console for 3.0.### CLI bootstrap file in app skeleton CLI context is often different from web context. Logging will be different", and additional cli command bootstrapping code may need to be loaded. To this end, an empty file could be included in the app skeleton. This would give an easy place for developers to hook their CLI only logic into.### Options and argumentsArgs passed to shell methods The non-option arguments for console commands should be passed to the shell methods like controller actions.The  ,  , and options are no longer required. Since CakePHP 3.0 won\'t have shared libraries these arguments become less important and mostly bloat.  methods will get positional arguments passed to their methods. Options will be available on  . The and options are used as a convention to control the output level of console commands.### Subcommand handling Currently CakePHP makes every public method callable from the terminal. Much like controllers this is a balance of ease of use and being explicit. Currently the console libraries have no way of hiding public actions. A possible improvement would be to leverage the existing subcommands in the option parsers.If a shell has no defined subcommands, all public methods can be called from the terminal.If a shell defines subcommands, only those  will be callable.  If a subcommand could match a task name, or a public method, the Task will be called. Tasks will have their main() called when they are set as a subcommand.  Tasks invoked as subcommands will have positional arguments sent to their main() method.Tasks cannot be directly called unless they are exposed through subcommands.### Command names and aliases By default the existing routing would be used for  commands. However, plugin or app shells can define shorter command aliases. Connected aliases would be looked at _only if_ matching an  shell fails. For example: This would enable to be callable. If however, an application defines an shell, that shell will be used instead. Aliased shells can still be invoked from their original name as well. The aliased forms would also be output by the CommandListShell.### Automatic aliasing and shortest  handling In addition to manual aliasing, CakePHP could automatically alias plugin shells as long as they do not conflict with  shells. If two plugins would result in the same alias being generated, neither will be aliased. In addition to automatic aliases, shell names, and subcommands would support being run via their shortest unambiguous name. For example would point to in a default installation. This short form handling would work for both shell names, and subcommand names," enabling to run  .### Tasks[x] Remove old flags.[x] Make Shell methods get positional arguments.[x] Add to app skeleton.[x] Add alias() method.[x] Rework how subcommands work.[x] Rename Task::execute() to Task::main() so it is consistent with Shell.[x] Automatic shell aliasing.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And you need to call floor or you won\'t have 1.Also I thought it was very bad because I baked  for my user and my UsersController index was showing something like \'2014-06-06 12:05AM\' and you refresh the page... you have \'2014-06-06 12:06AM\'.  The first thing that came to my head was \'why is my data updating itself if I\'m not doing anything?\'. I think the default output for a date type should be \'2014-06-06\', but if not possible, in the worst case \'2014-06-06 00:00AM\'.

In the same fashion," this ""ambassador"" would be responsible for returning the correct value to populate discriminator column when inserting new records", and so on.

My point is: personally, I would like to be able to add new descendants in a plugin, without having to edit the application\\\'s core code. For instance, I might have a CakesTable that extends my BakeryProductsTable in the core application, then add a CookiesTable that extends BakeryProductsTable as well in an optional plugin of which the core app might even be unaware of: having the list of descendants hardcoded in the BakeryProductsTable (see Doctrine\\\'s impl.) would be quite a problem, in such a case. :wink:\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This would be a MySQL-only solution; eventually it shouldabstract the database.By the way, in 2.x when I made a change to Cake\'s modelTask, etc., I copiedmy changed version into the app/ directory, and bake would look there firstand use that version before the lib/ version.

My problem now is I\'m not sure how to pass the needed objects the best way. Dependency injection would be nice in this case but we don\'t have it in the core. A possibility might be to pass a single object or an array of objects to the adapters and try to authenticate / authorize them.

However, only gives the original of the changed values, **and  for where the values remained the same**, not as you would expect it to behave like  .

cakephp,6654,closed,body,2015-05-27 15:30:58,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" Hi there", I\'ve just started learning (and using) the new Cake3 ORM and I\'m pretty confused about the way entities, save and validation work altogether. Assume we have some validations set in  . Amongst them: If I execute the following code in  : , to my surprise, the entity **WILL** be saved and there will be no errors printed.  On the other hand, if we execute the following code: , entity will **NOT** be saved (as it would be expected). I know validation is executed in or as a first measure. What shocks me is validation is not executed again in  , making modified fields bypass validation. I also know there\'s this Request Validation vs Application Rules separation now, but there\'s not a lot of documentation about what you can and can\'t achieve with Application Rules (which leads to think this is not a case for Application Rules). So, basically, what is the approach one should take in all this?It is weird and should be fixed?_Repatch_ the Entity after modifying it (or be forced to _repatch_ always instead of modifying)," and then call  ? (the attractiveness of having built an ORM decreases a lot here)Build these validations in the Application Rules instead? Thanks for your time!""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cakephp,6654,closed,1,2015-05-27 15:30:58,8.02,,1,,"b'b"" No. If your application is making changes to entities after they\'ve been built", I would recommend using patchEntity() to do those changes if you need data type validations done. Application rules are used to ensure consistency before saving. The thinking behind splitting validation and consistency checks is as follows. Generally unsafe data comes from the user, while internal application logic generally will not use incorrectly  data. Therefore, validation is most useful when entities are created from user data. By validating data before it is converted into an entity," we can not copy invalid data into an entity and prevent many inconsistent states before a save is event attempted.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cakephp,6654,closed,2,2015-05-27 15:30:58,12.68,,1,,"b'b"" Splitting validation", makes sense, but, from my point of view, it makes no sense not validating data passed to DB. I don\'t really care if the data was introduced by a user," or a developer... An ORM that allows wrong data be in the DB... doesn\'t really sounds as it should be.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
cakephp,6654,closed,3,2015-05-27 15:30:58,95.85,,1,,b'b\' So, basically, when we are defining validations in the model, we are actually defining user input validation now. I would understand this if the Application Rules feature offered the same range of built-in validations, but I think it doesn\\\'t (easily). A way to ensure every persisted Entity is fully consistent (wherever its data comes from) is not that crazy thing. The way it\\\'s built now easily allows invalid entities to be persisted. Long-time Cake developers are not used to this, and shit is probably gonna happen. For those interested in emulating the old Cake behaviour, you can maybe do this in your class: **EDIT: This patch below turned out not to be a good solution, since will be never be executed if the entity already had errors. So, basically," setting entity properties after a ""failed"" or would result in those properties not being validated anyway.**  (shittiest solution ever", I know). @markstory do you think this patch could have any side-efect (performance aside)? **EDIT: as mentioned above, not a good solution.**\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It seems strange to me that the internals of an application would create invalidate states that would fail validation. For me the validation that is done in newEntity()/patchEntity() should be used to check data format and data types.

cakephp,6654,closed,13,2015-05-27 15:30:58,803.8,,,1,"b'b"" I know that this issue is closed but I want to add some words to the discussion that maybe helps to rethink this subject.  One the things that I loved about cakephp 3 was the new _ORM & Database Access_", I understand and I do like the way application rules and validation rules were split. But (yeah, there is a but) I think **when** those rules are checked is to be reviewed.I would list some points I\'ve been thinking on this matter:1. It\'s a bit confused and not very intuitive to check validation rules as soon as data is assigned, and very often you would modify this data before you save it.2. It\'s not the way it works on cakephp 2, I know that many things don\'t, but it\'s less intuitive for those that migrate.3. Not always the data to build entities comes from forms, or from users data, it\'s very common to save related data that are build from other services (gis data, ip, ua, etc.), or data that needs to be processed before you save it. I think that, in this particular case, it\'s great to having the chance to work directly upon an entity, taking advantage of working with objects. Right now we should do it on an array, and then pass it to or methods, because those only accept an array as new data (if I am right). 4. Many times we hear that a good programming practice is to having methods that do what they claim to do, neither nor are very good in this aspect. It\'s not very easy to guess that they will validate the data, and already less intuitive that some data may get lost and not be there (on the entity). 5. Finally, we don\'t have a method on Table Objects, to validate in a explicit way, like in cakephp 2. ## So, the solution? Beside thinking about the weak points of this approach, I been thinking on some possible solutions.  We already have an option for and to disable validation, as have an option on method to disabled application rule checking (all of them usefull for us to modify the validation workflow). And Table Objects are responsible of all of them (patch, new, save), I think a solution could be adding an option to method, with default value  . If it\'s  , then entity would be validated before attempting to check application rules or save if  . As an alternative or in addition to, we could also have a property (and its respective method to handle it) on table objects to determine when validation occurs.  Something like... This would allow as to setup this behavior on a per Table basis. Also default value should be \'build\', to avoid breaking the API. And finally it would be great to have an explicit method on Table Objects," to validate when we want to.""'",,,
cakephp,6654,closed,14,2015-05-27 15:30:58,272.58,,,1,"b'b"" One challenge with this will be that all the validation methods would need to be compatible with pre and post casting representations of the data. While I think the core rules should be fine"," I\'m not quite as sure that application rules will always abide by that requirement. Associations could also complicate a method as well. It too would need to know which associations should be recursed into and have validation rules applied to them. Handling the association traversal is one of the reasons validation is done on entity build. I think having a method could be a nice addition to the Table class. Adding more modes and options to could muddle the ORM and make usage even more unclear to new and existing developers.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It expects an array as data, and despite the fact that works with entities (just because entities implements ArrayAccess), throws a warning.2. Does not fill errors on the entity.3. It\\\'s a bit weird that validators works with arrays, when they are built or filled on table objects which works with entities.

Further more may be the case that every record needs to be preprocessed in order to extract the data that cares to the entity and who\\\'s better than the entity itself to handle this, so, in this use case it\\\'s pretty common to have a workflow like this I put this only as an example of when you could get invalid or corrupted data set directly inside the application and not from forms.

Well, as  I can see, mashaller is taking care of entity creation, filling up properties and data validation as well, so something like this seems to work: But besides of being an ugly solution (I don\\\'t like passing references and I like even less to overwrite it that way), have some problems when working with associations:  For example, if we pass as parameter an entity with related entities associated to it," they will _""get lost (as entities)""_ when calling  ", and it\\\'ll be needed to indicate those relations explicitly in $options, as when calling  , regardless of (may be) they were correctly set on the entity at first time.

Here is where comes in handy to create an entity and then filling it with data, but working upon an entity object, other way, using or  , you should do it in an array, and you would end up creating the entity only as a data wrapper to validate and save, losing all the advantages of working with entity objects.

Create database we\'ll use in our CakePHP project using script below: ## 2. Use composer to create the CakePHP project Command is: php  create-project prefer-dist  [app_name] ## 3. Bake all files necessary to have a basic CRUD application Command is:  bake all time_sheets ## 4. Insert proper DB credentials in [app_name]/  ## 5. Change  view input fields to 12 hour format. Something like this: ## 6. Navigate a browser to [yourprojecturl]/time_ ## 7. Populate start and end time fields with todays date, and 12:10pm and 12:50pm, respectively. Populate other fields however you like. ## 8. Click submit, and observe that the times are both marked as invalid. # My investigation results So I spent some time debugging and have discovered the source of the bug, which seems to be in CakePHP core (specifically, ).  The reason your test case passes is because the values in the data array containing time information are stored as strings, and not ints. See this screenshot: ![screenshot from 2015-09-24 16 32 54]url  And due to the way the validation check works in , arrays of ints will pass where arrays of strings will not. See for yourself with the tests below, the first will pass and the latter will fail: I\'ve narrowed the problem down to a strange bit of code in  (around line 1184 in the version I cloned using the reproduction instructions above, the function in question is \'_getDateString()\') that will convert a string type hour equalling 12 to 24, which is then marked as an invalid time by a regular expression comparison farther down the line in the validation process. I did all this using xdebug, which was very handy.  I tried fixing the bug myself," but ended up with more problems than I started with.

I don\\\'t know where to put this new ""core"" js file. Maybe you want to force to load this js file", or rather have it in your app skeleton, so the user can check it and copy the code. But I think that is something I can\\\'t tell so far. ;) Sorry guys, but CSP is also quite new for me and I was just requesting this, because I would love CakePHP to directly support this. But I also guess it is not done with one simple pull request. :wink: As I read it here ( url  ) and if I understand it correctly Rails 3 doesn\\\'t create inline js code anymore but providing specific information in the html data attribute and you have to load this file url  so the javascript is working.

This because I want one rule to be always checked if it\\\'s true, for example: I have 2 kind of ACO\\\'s, controllers (the normal one) and department, and 2 ARO\\\'s, Users and Roles. A role has a set of permissions with some controllers, just like normal. But, now I want to create a permission between an User and a department (user can also have different departments). Users should not be able to access other departments which they don\\\'t belong to, so this always needs to be checked. When this returns false, it should stop. When it returns true," it should continue to the next adapter.  When I set my ""master"" to the last one", it isn\\\'t always checked when one of my previous authorizers return true (then normally it stops checking).

The resource logic is being build up by the routes. That\'s where the URLs structure for HTTP calls is being defined.I can see that you might want to have a trait or something for controllers that automatically traverses up and checks stuff... Doing it that way however (instead of having similar logic in your model layer) will create multiple checking queries (instead of inner joins).It is true that your models would inherit the REST compatible nesting of resources (e.g. of ) build up as a tree.

I think we need something like in your example and something to connect to namespaces with $routes->connect. And why not enhance ::Scope to handle a namespace", and all routes inside will be scopeNamespace + routeNamespace + routeController.I don\'t know if it\'s a good design but it\'s an idea. You are right the only thing that change between cake and the other framework is that we can create a rest resource with a particular classname, but that solve a lot of problem... Sorry if I was unclear. I\'ll try to explain why it is a good idea to route to namespace for rest ressources. First it\'s useless for simple application like in the example.... It\'s a fact that Rest and a traditional MC model is not the best way to handle this use cases. It\'s difficult to make combinaison of contexts,... Given these facts we need to enhance this functionnality because we can\'t easily create context without namespaces. And it\'s not my invention take a look how this project is organised url  Before cake 3 we didn\'t have namespace, so some of us use plugin to easily create context. But now it\'s possible so we need to use it. Why the prefix option routes to a different namespace ? because a controller inside a prefix context is not a controller inside another context... **One example** We have an user, UsersController can easily handle the  context and the defaut context (when we get this user). We do it without thinking about it, nothing strange here. Now we have a profile, adress, and so many controllers that ONLY exist in the user context. So we need an Users namespace. Now we have :UsersControllerUsers\\\\ProfilesControllerUsers\\\\AdressesController The response to this : it\'s useless. Yes **it\'s useless if we think like in classic cakephp MVC app**. Users controller deserialize the whole thing and the model save the associations, we maybe only need one controller etc... So now think Rest. Ok, we use the actual thing ->resource . We create all the controllers in the same namespace and in each we check if we are inside the user context, since the resource only exist in this context. Now, I want a common logic to all controllers in user context (and no, trait is not a good choice I think), I want to easily beforeFilter for this context," I want to multiply the number of these cotnroller by 10 without probelm. I understand nothing to ruby but what I understand is that the gitlab example seems like what I want to do (and what I already do in large app). So my solution is :Add support for classic namespace routing with ->connectAdd support for Controller name option for rest nestedAdd support for rest nested namespace routing With these three things we cover a lot of situations.

This is adding an option to the validation stage before data insertion, so why can we not offer an option that MySQL does not? There are multiple threads calling for MySQL to support this, so it\'s clearly a wanted feature but still, I don\'t see how it should affect what Cake offers? If Cake only offered validation options that were available in MySQL, then surely there would be no need for the Cake Validation stage in the first place? I\'m all up for suggestions.

I understand that these pull requests take a lot of time to make, and I didn\'t mean to sound like I was slamming the door on the PR. I don\'t have authority here to reject PRs and was just stating an opinion, and maybe not a very good one at that. I\'m of the opinion that is an anti-value. It can represent a state but not a value. You can say that a record belongsTo ABC or when null it belongsTo nothing. From a data stand point that makes sense, but it\'s difficult to say that a record can belongsTo nothing only once. We can count things in the dataset with or  . So for validation I think that will work, but I think its an indication of a problem in the database schema rather than a limitation on the validation rules. So I worry that this encourages the usage of as a value where underlying data storage will not. Again," this is just my opinion. It does change often ;)""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

AFAIR, MySQLs BDB engine supported as a unique value, however that engine is gone since 5.1, so it\\\'s not relevant for CakePHP anymore. SQL Server on the other hand supports it (it always did if I\\\'m not mistaken, and you have to use filters to change this behavior), which some people like, and some don\\\'t, as it contradicts the ANSI standard. With respect to that historical behavior, being able to represent this in the form of an application rule might come handy for some SQL Server peeps, whether this justifies core feature relevance however is of debatable nature. Rethinking it, I think I\\\'d now possibly tend more towards, nah, might not be an overly good idea, enforcing standards on that level of the abstraction layer might be better. Making the rule more extensible may be a compromise, so that people could easily modify the conditions without having to reimplement the whole rules logic.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Then error just popup in my screen. I have done nothing else than just edited one input tag in *.ctp file. Nothing else, Not edited *.po file, not change or touch any PHP config files etc. I open another url in my project, same error message in there to. I open third url, no changes. I refresh pages, nothing happens. _Only way to get off that error was restart Apache_. Because this error shows as in two different libraries and every urls in project and only disappears when restart Apache, I think this is bug on PHP,  not Cake nor Chronos nor Carbon.

I guess this was the intention of the commit, but it breaks backward compatibility, and it will confuse people who expect Cake to handle the uniqueness of null values the same way that the underlying SQL indexes do (as was the case prior to 3.2.9).

Both fields are empty, so both rules determines that the other field can\\\'t be empty, as a result, both inputs on the form has the required attribute.

Which has some sense, since I\\\'m telling the framework that those field are allowed to be empty, but, in the other hand, a validation may be checking also the context data, so there should be a way of telling validator to apply some rules no matter the field is allowed to be empty.

cakephp,9325,closed,body,2016-08-22 14:52:11,00:00,,,1,"b'b"" This is a (multiple allowed):[ ] bug[x] enhancement[x] feature-discussion (RFC) In 3.3", we added a PSR7 \'bridge\' component. For 3.4, I\'m proposing that implement the PSR7  . This provides a few benefits:Consistency across the framework. Both middleware and  will have access to the PSR7 interface methods.More immutable objects. Immutable objects have some nice benefits and having more of them feels like a good thing.Less duplication. Currently our request object, and the PSR7 transformers duplicate a significant amount of code with diactoros. By adopting the PSR7 features in we would be able to remove a large chunk of duplicate code. I also feel that the PSR7 interfaces help promote consistency across different PHP frameworks, which is beneficial to new users who have used other PHP frameworks. We of course will continue to offer additional \'sugar\' methods that make using the PSR7 objects more ergonomic. For example setting cache headers will continue to have higher level methods, as the PSR7 interfaces are too low-level.## Dealing with Mixed Mode Operations in Requests Currently our request objects are mutable, while PSR7 requests are _immutable_. Bridging this gap will seamlessly is not be feasible. Instead, I\'m proposing we take the same approach we took with  , and continue to honor in-place mutation for the existing methods, while offering new immutable interfaces.## Combined  The methods that act as both a setter & getter would be deprecated. New getters would be added that follow the PSR7 conventions more closely. For example and  . We would introduce new methods for the setter mode in the conventional PSR7 style: New setters would be introduced:  ## Deprecate ArrayAccess methods The ArrayAccess interface was added in 2.x to provide an easier upgrade path from 1.x. This interface would be deprecated in 3.4. It is not possible to support ArrayAccess and immutable objects long term. Long term, this would remove calls like:  ## Deprecate magic methods The current magic methods  , would be deprecated. These interfaces are infrequently used, and become harder to support in an immutable context. This would break access like:  ## Deprecate public properties The existing public properties  ,  ,  ,  ,  , and would be deprecated. Instead data should be read through  public methods: The  , and parameters would be replaced with the existing sugar methods: The current public URI properties would be available as request \'attributes\', or be exposed through new methods that match the PSR7 conventions: Because attributes and the existing public properties do not share the same storage, we would need to leverage  , and to emulate the properties using the PSR7 storage. Most of the emulated properties are scalar values which is great, as they are simple to emulate. However,  , and are arrays, and emulating arrays with and can have some limitations. I think this is a situation where we would need documentation in the migration guide to explain the limitations.# Impact to Existing Components Several core components would be effected by the switch to immutable request objects, and would need to be rebuilt. While these updates are not critical for 3.4.0 as we\'ll continue to support the in-place mutation methods, long term we need to replace the effected components with middleware based solutions, and I think it is important to have plans now on how those updates will be done. I am not recommending these changes be done in 3.4.0. In order to keep releases smaller, component to middleware changes could be done in 3.5.0.## Convert CsrfComponent to Middleware This component could be replaced entirely by a middleware layer. The component could be deprecated entirely," we could recommend people update to the new Middleware layer.## RequestHandlerComponent Input Parsing The input parsing feature of would need to be moved into middleware. The other features of RequestHandlerComponent could stay in the component.### beforeRedirect conversion into requestAction This feature should be deprecated and planned for removal in 4.x. This feature was missed in the 2.x deprecations and should be removed now.## Convert SecurityComponent to Middleware SecurityComponent token validation could be converted into Middleware as well. The and features could be moved into a separate middleware allowing each layer to be more focused on solving specific problems. The underlying token validation and token generation should be moved into a utility class that can be re-used in both the component and middleware layer.# Unimpacted Core ComponentsAuthComponent No impact as auth manipulates the session which is not-immutable.FlashComponent Uses Session data exclusively.CookieComponent Uses Cookies which go into the Response (which is a separate harder problem).## TODO[x] Implement PSR7 interface on request.  [x] Attribute methods  [x] Query string methods  [x] Server parameter methods  [x] Cookie methods  [x] HTTP method methods  [x] Parsed Body methods  [x] Uploaded Files methods  [x] Body stream methods  [x] Request target methods  [x] Protocol Version methods  [x] Header methods  [x] Implement interface  [x] Uri methods[x] Make ServerRequestFactory return a Network\\\\Request instance.[x] Deprecate and remove usage of RequestTransformer.

So what is happening is that buffered queries are using SplFixedArray", and that object is being serialized when written to the cache. When the ResultSet is restored from the cache PHP is failing to properly restore the inner state of SplFixedArray. The ResultSet successfully loads the items in the cache, but the count for items is set to zero. The data is there but it will fail trying to iterate any of the items.  I\'ve updated the PR this morning to improve serializing. It no longer uses SplFixedArray when writing to the cache, but converts the result set to a regular array. When the result set is deserialized from cache it\'s converted back into a new SplFixedArray instance with a proper count value.  Based upon what I\'ve read in your post. The PR should fix your issue.  I do not know why this bug started to appear, but I\'ve been on slack today talking @lorenzo who also experienced this issue on  a different version of PHP. The code that introduced this issue was added to Cake a year ago, but this issue seems to have just started recently.  Spl is a core component of PHP since 5.3. What I think might have happen is that some thing in Cake recently changed in one of the iterator traits we use, and that introduced the bug so that would not work.  Anyway," the bug is fixed now. It\'ll be in the next Cake update.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In the meatime I also  started looking into it, and found a way to reproduce it in a contained example. What I found is that returned 0 when used in the unserialize function directly. Outside of the class however, after the full is unserialized, would return the correct amount. So there is some code being executed right after the complete object is unserialized (php internals that is probably).  Now I found this: [SplFixedArray::__wakeup]url The suggested to me it would be private," but apparently it is not and can be called in the function right after SplFixedArray is unserialized and stored in  .

Currently this method is called  . This  would be deprecated. * Apply all the cookies matching this request. Currently calls this method  . This behavior for would be deprecated and could be shimmed by looking for cookie \'names\' that contain the URL sub-pattern.

If I add a **new**  Event  with  Dates  then it fails! The id of the new  Event  is not persisted at the moment of the test and the rule will fail. BUT it should not fail. In my opinion the rule need to know if the parent entity  isNew()  but at the moment the invoked parameters does not provide any information about this.  line 80: The options array does not provide any useful information aswell:  For sure I can easily replace the created default ExistsIn rule.

Off in fpm config.  ### What you did We were doing final testing of our app after major upgrade and noticed that some code does not work as it should. The code is highly dependent on session variables as they hold the state. The script updates the state in the session just before redirecting and then we noticed," that the variable that is written before the redirect is not written to the session itself. It does succeed after ca. 8-10 attempts. ### What happened I am not sure how much of a problem it is but it\\\'s not something that is wildly discussed other places. I also have a feeling this could somehow be related to #11162. I can reproduce this behavior on my php-fpm setup every time. I cannot reproduce it when running on cakephp built-in server. The following snippet shows the problem (controller action):  If you access the url as it should print the timestamp recorded at the time of the redirect. But it does not. If you manage to save the timestamp you will notice it is not changing on subsequent requests where is in the URL. Snippet above will work EVERY time if you add the following after and before the statement:   Then it works flawlessly as intended. Session data is written automatically on and if I terminate the script with an before the return then data is also saved correctly in the database. ### What you expected to happen Where does it come from. It ""used to work"" w/o problems on older PHP  version. I would expect it just worked as intended i.e. when I do I would like to have that data stored in the session.  How is the administered internally by cakephp? Isn\\\'t it an idea to add it into the and check whether session is started etc. and then explicitly close it?
