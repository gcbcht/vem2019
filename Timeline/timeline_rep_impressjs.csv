impressjs,5,open,11,2012-01-01 21:13:27,33.72,,,1,b'b\' Hey guys. That\\\'s great that you have such enthusiasm to build authoring tool. Just few things to keep in mind. First of all,  is just a library that takes handles positioning and transitions between the slides. The markup is just HTML (with some predefined structure) and the styles are pure CSS, they are not connected to  in any way. As I see it now, everyone who uses  just copies  from demo. It shouldn\\\'t happen, CSS should be prepared for a presentation to suit the content. So it will be a great challenge to create authoring tool that will handle creation of HTML content and custom CSS styling. Second thing. It\\\'s a **very** early release. It doesn\\\'t have any number," but it\\\'s like 0.1 alpha codename ""not finished yet""", you know ;) I don\\\'t know if it will happen, but there may be some significant changes (for example to HTML structure), and probably some public JavaScript API will be available at some point (to allow triggering transitions to chosen slides).Keep that in mind, please, and watch for the changes in repo.I will probably start giving some version numbers soon, so you will know with which version you are working, etc. Keep me posted if there is anything you need in terms of understanding how  works or in terms of stuff you\\\'d need in API.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
impressjs,5,open,12,2012-01-01 21:13:27,6.82,,,1,"b'b"" Hi Bartaz",  that is exactly what i expected. I will focus on positioning for now since those attributes can\'t change to much i guess. For positioning:I\'m thinking of some type of grid where you can snap those slides in the 3D space plus a  system similar to most 3d modelling applications working with arrows that can be dragged on the respective axis.

Being able to author on a tablet is key.  Strut and Impressionist didn\'t work very well for me on my ipad, so for now for me it\'s S9 + , and on the ipad: Mimpress (on the theory that the two approaches are mostly compatible). @volca: some issues with Mimpress: there\'s no way to manage svg files, and image file mgmt is a bit wonky, as is the CSS style mgmt (I can\'t share it easily, which I need to do if I\'m going to use S9 on my desktop and mimpress on my ipad).  There\'s no nice share with e-mail or whatever, just copy to clipboard (which, ok, is not terrible, but still).  Also, Mimpress isn\'t rendering lists properly...  It crashes when displaying the whole canvas if the presentation uses your svg file. Also, there\'s no export function in Mimpress.  An export to HTML option would be nice, and obviously shouldn\'t be too hard (given that you are probably already using S9), but as long as I can send the markdown to my desktop I can pass it to slideshow there (I\'ve not tried it though, and I worry that there might be incompatibilities).

This process is somewhat simplified using existing  ""editors""", but I found they mess up the html with un-needed tags. Therefore, I created a simple php script that modifies the  attributes with a simple command. I was wondering if this can be shared, and if so where would be a nice place to put it. Ideally, it could be translated into a browser extension, but I don\\\'t know js enough. I would be happy to contribute if anyone started up a project. In the meanwhile I am happy to share my script, if there is any interest. Any suggestion on  appreciated Here are typical usages, to give you an idea of what the script accomplishes. Examplesphp  f list available slides and their id, if presentphp  f  steps 3-5 x -20 y =200  decrease data-x by 20 and set data-y to 200 on slides 3,4,5 of  and overwrite the filephp  f  output  steps 2,3,8-9 x d20 fm  increase the data-x gap between slides 2 and 3, 3 and 8, and  8 and 9 by 20. Slides 2 remains unchanged. Data-x will be set wherever missingphp  f  steps 5-2,overview,8  process slides in the following order: 5,4,3,2,[id=overview],5,4\'',,,,

impressjs,5,open,68,2012-01-01 21:13:27,765.32,,,1,b'b\' @dcsan I really wanted to implement hyperlinks and images sooner, but we couldn\\\'t make it happen within our grant budget, so I\\\'ll be working on it in my spare time. In fact, C&C supports any arbitrary HTML for the scenarios (we have a sample story that actually loads a Prezi INTO a C&C ), it\\\'s just that we haven\\\'t provided the tools yet to do it from the front end. It can only be done thru CSV right now, which is a transitional format we\\\'ve decided to use for loading in sample stories before implementing a relational database which might not even be necessary. I\\\'m definitely going to be adding those features though, as this is an app I want to use myself. I truly believe that if we are aiming to get more users on-board, we will need to add the features which are typical to most slideshow building apps in order to make it all around more useful for more types of people. As of right now, you can link slides (scenarios) together without writing any code by adding buttons to scenarios and editing those buttons to point them to other scenarios. You can also edit the title and body text, but again this is just plain text and I\\\'m looking forward to including more components," templates and formatting options in the future. If you load the sample story ""Example 7.1"" it offers a good representation of our initial direction laying out the story in a flow tree with ability to link new scenarios or edit existing ones on the fly", or switch to reading mode on the fly. There is no compile time, the edit and reading modes are unified, what you  is what everyone gets. :) Another bonus is that Choices & Chances works offline, saving  regularly when a connection is available, similar to Google Docs. I engineered most of these things before I had a chance to learn , and before Prezi announced their HTML5 version (I saw them hiring for an HTML5 guy so I knew it was coming). The freedom of not using a library was rewarding. The challenge comes with having to do nearly everything in Javascript, since we try to maintain roughly 90% functionality while offline and can\\\'t rely on the server for most things. I\\\'ve taken inspiration from software of which I enjoyed the , such as the File, View, Edit menus similar to , the ability to re-arrange these menus (they used to be panels that you can keep open like in Photoshop, but we\\\'ve simplified it for the time being), a Properties panel for the selected object with ability to edit many of its properties similar to Photoshop or 3D Max, multiple display options for accessibility or preference similar to Windows, flat-UI similar to modern trends, OAuth2 for login," a general full-screen ""video game"" or ""couch"" or ""conference room"" approach", etc... Thanks for your interest, it\\\'s not often that I get to share this kind of detailed information since the stuff I do is fairly obscure.\''

impressjs,5,open,70,2012-01-01 21:13:27,779.75,1,,,b'b\' @dcsan I\\\'ve actually never seen Twinery. Makes me wonder if it was around during the time I had been researching Prezi-like web apps. It looks pretty much like what we\\\'re doing with C&C. The best I could find at the time was MindMeister, Prezi, Sozi, and the various  authoring tools in the discussions here on Github. JSpres is gone, I liked that one. While Strut delivers a UX reminiscent of PowerPoint, it just doesn\\\'t innovate. Anyway, the C&C repo is privately hosted at BitBucket, but we may move it over to Github for open contribution. Discussion is valuable to the project, so I went ahead and created the Github repo [here]url  as a starting point. Discuss all you want! In your first screenshot showing how Twinery maps text, that\\\'s essentially what our CSV achieves. The CSV format is what allowed our non-technical team member(s) to produce stories in a text editor before the app was ever functional. They would have had a difficult time writing stories in raw JSON, so a rudimentary story format was one of the first things we designed. Our CSV could use some refinement to bring it more in line with a Wiki-like syntax. We haven\\\'t revisited the syntax yet, but it\\\'s on the list. It was planned to dump the CSV files altogether once we built the authoring tools into the front end. Real-time story collaboration was another thing that was in the plan, but didn\\\'t make the cut. Meteor is cool, I like what they\\\'re going for. I\\\'ve recently taken on a massive overview of Meteor-like frameworks which has yielded a lot of insights and new ideas. I\\\'d like to finish and implement []url  into C&C," and while it does work for the other ""top secret"" project I\\\'m developing around it", it\\\'s still a work in progress so Meteor isn\\\'t totally out of the question.  lets you declare and use components as well as JSON data straight in your HTML template e.g.: ...would output a list of Game titles. I\\\'m still experimenting with it too. You might find it interesting (or scary) to know how much under the hood is first-class, custom functionality. The flowtree algorithm was developed from scratch, it\\\'s not a Rhinegold-Tilford or something you would find in D3.js. Still a few kinks to iron out with it though. No jquery-ui for the drag-drop since I wanted the  modes unified with 3D editing capability and realistic positioning of the scenarios. We\\\'re using [this]url  OAuth2 component for social login, also developed by yours truly, so we have Login with . Hope to hear from you at the Github repo.\'',,,,,,,,,,

Impressionist otoh is based on Electron, so you install and run it as a desktop app, and it saves files on your desktop as well. There\'s a video demo in the README if you want to see more.  (To clarify: There\'s no relation to the other Impressionist editor that is mentioned in this thread. It seems to no longer be actively developed, and URL stopped working?)

I have a simple solution that will keep this working for you outside of an iFrame and allow you to dev for mobile and more Simply create a div block that the impress div will live in.div id=""object""  div id=""impress""  // Your presentation objects here  /div/div Lets say you want to your ""impress"" window at the top left and have two divs at the bottom and right that have other content in them Simply create two divs"," one at the bottom and one at the right using absolute position and right: 0 and bottom: 0use width and height percentages to create a box effect. Now go in to your impress javascript file and hit up line 380:top: ""50%""","left: ""50%""", adjust these numbers to place where impress centers the step slidesI chose 35% and 40% to meet what I need and that placed it more towards the top left If you need the ability to scroll on the page simply wrap all of this in a div thats locked to the top and adjust it so that  the background size uses webkit: cover; In hopes that I haven\\\'t wasted your time, I hope this helps. P.S. what i just did was simple, and can still be accomplished if your trying to provide an element view the size of lets say a youtube video, and you are sticking that in a wordpress template, then an iframe may be needed but is not required. Though a bit more time intensive you can still make this method work with what your intent is. Impress can be edited enough not to lock to the cover edges giving you this freedom, but that is not something I am going in to here. ![Screen Shot 2013-01-30 at 11 06 06 AM]url \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Of course, that would imply nobody else should merge anything to master either, but given that this isn\'t happening anyway, not a huge problem.  That said, what are we worried about exactly? Stable releases are tagged, so if users want stable, they should use that. If they use master, they probably want the latest and greatest, so why not finally give them that?

Those PRs were not created with an [atomic concern]url  that makes it extremely hard to review because it trades off quality of review for speed of delivery and keeping the context of the code in the author\\\'s head. Creating structured PRs allow for somebody else in the future (maybe another contributor) to understand the reasoning behind each feature. For example, if adding a plugin, it\\\'s possible to add only the API in  that is necessary for that plugin to work. That will ensure the API doesn\\\'t expose anything other than what\\\'s necessary to satisfy that use case, reviewing that we efficiently avoid clutter and [remove code]url I\\\'ve mentioned this before, but it seems that [@bartaz and yourself are ok with the tradeoff of quality of review (and the efforts to do so) for speed of delivery]url  I would argue that\\\'s not something that\\\'s worth it because it will make the codebase rigid (more on this later), but I won\\\'t insist on it if we\\\'re all conscious of this tradeoff and that\\\'s the only way forward. Does that mean you believe the code is very good? If that\\\'s so, why create a Pull Request? What needs to be reviewed exactly? Shouldn\\\'t you just commit to master?  That statement [can be a fallacy]url  I intended to look at the branch against master and review it again, [as mentioned a month ago]url  It also opens the possibility for a wider audience to peek in. I\\\'m not sure how active are the watchers of this repo, but if there\\\'s a slight chance to have [more eyeballs]url  into this, shouldn\\\'t we do it?  Yes, I could just look at the [  diff]url  However, a Pull Request creates noise and maybe (just maybe) somebody else can jump in and add something useful to the discussion. Would that possibility be worth it? From what I\\\'ve seen so far, even though the merge promises to close a lot of feature requests from this repo, it adds a lot of code that will now be exposed to a much bigger audience. The code might be stable and working today, however, it seems that it provides **stability** and **more features** at the cost of:  * **Rigidness**. Due to the increase of software entropy and the lack of tests and [self-documentation]url  the code becomes more rigid. That means that new contributors will be afraid to change the code more than before. Because it didn\\\'t have tests before it actually makes this problem worse, not better. * **Less developer contribution**. Future contributors won\\\'t be able to easily create Pull Requests for new features or fixes to be added to the project and it might stale or only be contributed by @henrikingo who has the context of how it works. Right now," the merge increases @henrikingo\\\'s [Bus Factor]url  in the project. Tests can also serve as a documentation of how the impress API works in code (the so-called ""first client"" of the API)", if there are no tests for contributors to look at, new contributors will have to spend so much time to understand everything that they will most likely give up.  My understanding at this moment (and I partly blame on how the format of the review was done) is that this merge optimizes feature delivery by sacrificing contribution and the flexibility of  core.  **Of course, I can be wrong...**  I don\\\'t have the whole context of the features added. That\\\'s why I intended to look at the branch as a whole in a Pull Request and see if that would make things clearer.  I was only able to look at small isolated and non-cohesive snapshots of changes.  **But if I\\\'m right...**  If I\\\'m right and @bartaz and @henrikingo are ok with the tradeoffs I listed there, then I won\\\'t insist on it and it should be good to go to  .  I just want to make sure we make the conscious decision because I also want  to succeed, not to become worse from a maintainability perspective.

Let\'s try not to mix too much emotions in this, as it\'s not very helpful. There may be some misunderstandings between us, disagreements, but let\'s try not take it too personally because it\'s unnecessary for anyone. Every single one of us contributes their free time to this in their own way, and let\'s respect that.  For the sake of this thread about merging dev branch to master. I was hoping (I believe similar to @FagnerMartinsBrack) that we discuss and address at least some of things mentioned in #626 before the merge. But as I understand @henrikingo intention is to address them now, so I assume that it will happen before moving out of \'beta\'.  And because of master being in \'beta\' I think it would be nice to have a note in readme that would point to last \'stable\' release.  About the comments about rigidness and outside contributions from @FagnerMartinsBrack. You are probably right that this may happen. But it will be hard to avoid when codebase gets bigger and gets more features. Naturally it will be more \'scary\' to newcomers. Now with plugin architecture maybe it will change once they settle in and are documented enough. But to see that we probably need to wait couple of weeks or months for some contributions to appear. Personally I don\'t expect much, because even that  seemed to be quite popular as a project there was not really a \'community\' around that. First I was the \'bus factor\' and project stopped when I stopped. Having @henrikingo as a contributor is at least some way forward, because of his willingness to contribute code and maintain it. It\'s better to have one developer active then endlessly discussing how to make code more approachable to contributors and have no contributors at all (in my opinion).  And, getting back to the emotions from the beginning if we want to attract more people to the project and have more contributions we need to try to be friendly and respectful for them. So let\'s start with trying this between ourselves :)  So to summarise," @henrikingo what are the next steps?  I\'d like to see before we remove beta flag:   addressing items from #626.

Therefore you want to be able to zoom and pan so that a few  are in view. After roaming around a bit, you pick up your prepared story by clicking next. (Though it is also possible to click another slide and proceed from there.)  This rough implementation works in Chrome at least and on my MacBook touchpad. It doesn\'t use the camera plugin, because I didn\'t understand that plugins code and functioning yet, so I rolled my own for now. There are several issues that need to be fixed and thought over before I can turn this into a proper plugin (it\'s just an addition at the bottom of the presentation\'s html file). Issues are\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  * Mousedown capturing somehow blocks the toolbar slide list. * Zoom works fine as far as I can see, pan works fine as far as I can, but if you pan first and zoom then you\'ll find that the transform origin has not panned along. This should be solvable by manipulating impress_, but whatever I try that will not allow itself to be set form the script. I have no idea why. * Obviously this is not plugin level yet, but if I can figure these problems out, I will turn it into a proper plugin. * I haven\'t looked at progressiveness and compatibility yet, for now I\'m trying to get this working in current (65) Chrome.
