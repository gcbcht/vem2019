AutoMapper,305,closed,19,2013-02-21 07:27:14,693.97,1,,,b'b\' @jbogard I think the proposal and the PR was for an opt-in duplicate-checking behavior, not to change the default behavior. Let me throw my vote in that this would be an incredibly time-saving feature. We have something like 15 mapper profiles across shared PCLs, Xamarin projects, and web API projects. I just spent a long time tracking down a bug (not the first, and probably not the last) where a developer added a mapping from  in profile B when the mapping already existed in profile A, and it led to unexpected behavior.  Why shouldn\\\'t the developer have just searched for an existing mapping before adding a new one? It\\\'s incredibly difficult to accurately search for mappings across profiles to see if has already been registered, because you\\\'re specifying types," which can be namespace-qualified or not. So in this case you could search for and not find anything because profile A is registered as or or whatever. And combing through 500 references of to find the one that\\\'s used in the mapper profile is time-consuming and most developers don\\\'t do it.  Not to mention that once you add in a duplicate mapping the only way you know which mapping is ""first"" and which is ""second"" is by examining the profile registrations", which could exist in a completely different assembly, or in our case, in multiple assemblies (one in  startup, one in iOS startup, etc). We had a really confusing situation where a mapping was incorrect, and we changed the mapping to be correct but for some reason when running the application it was still doing it incorrectly. After lots of cleaning, rebuilding, pulling our hair out we realized that, oh, we have _two_ mappings, we had changed the second (which wasn\\\'t actually influencing anything at all) and the original one was incorrect.  Managing all of that becomes a real pain and source of unexpected behavior. This is an *opt-in* behavior that would really help us out (and others, it sounds like).  @dariusdamalakas @jbogard Could we re-open this?\'',,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'ve seen this done with []url  which puts the following into the Post-build event command line: I think this would be a bit cleaner. Also, this is probably an edge case, but I was experimenting with creating my own NuGet package for a custom library, and I made AutoMapper one of the dependencies. When I went to install my custom NuGet package, I ran into this error dialog: ![conflicting file dialog]url  If I replace the AutoMapper dependency with , this problem goes away, so this suggests the post-build solution would potentially eliminate this issue with the unsaved project being externally modified.

I\\\'m thinking of something like: I\\\'d have overloads for the ctor: And the configuration provider, if you wanted to initialize that by itself, could have a ctor too: Technically configuration is still mutable after Seal(), since you can still go into TypeMaps and do whatever, grab the instance of the configuration and so on.# Motivation The static has been haunting me for years. Threading issues, order-of-operations, I can\\\'t fix that until I get rid of the statics. The changes in inheritance in 4.x have opened enough issues that I want to be deliberate about this move.# Upgrade path If you\\\'re using  , it\\\'s a matter of replacing the outer path with the real thing. I want to use the class and a class. I would obsolete all the static methods, obsolete the MappingEngine class and make the Mapper class inherit from it for 4.2. Then in 5.0, remove all the static. Users, instead of calling , would use a mapper instance directly, which they can make static all they like. Or configure in a container, whatever.# Static compromise ~~Another option is to keep and and nothing else. Still include static field for the mapper and the configuration instances. I would still remove the static keyword from Mapper and move the MappingEngine pieces inside of Mapper," with the clear signal that ""you might want to use the instance methods"".~~  I want to move to a class called ""Mapper"" and in C# a static method hides an instance method of the same name.

(Can resolve from IoC or pass a list of mappers)Can Mock and berate Automapper for unit tests (IMapper interface needed though) As far as IMapper goes could I suggest just having &  and have extensions from IMapper that do the generic implementations with documentation.That way the mockers only have to mock 2 function calls instead of all the functions which call these two functions.This is a personal preference of mine, with interfaces and overriding function calls.  There might be reasons I\'m not aware of that would cause problems by doing this, other than accidentally mocking extension methods.  I can make a PR showing example on how I would implement this.Also IMapper shouldn\'t have anything but Map functions I think, cause that\'s all it should be doing.

The whole ""get rid of the static API"" thing isn\\\'t really a big issue for me.  Jimmy\\\'s reasons make sense.  So","Go for it!"".  Make the internals simple and thread-safe.  :+1:  All that other stuff about how best to use Automapper with Linq, changing configuration settings, expression builder, factories, ORMs, etc -I\\\'m not so much interested in any of that. I more or less restrict my use of AutoMapper to 2 uses cases. 1) to go from IDataReader to a list of DTO\\\'s. 2) to map Models to ViewModels and back.  I\\\'ve written very large apps and smallish apps with those use cases.  I want to advocate for those use cases to be  extremely lean. I should also mention that I\\\'m a member of that certain class of programmers who rips out dependency injection and the ORMs (and can still unit test just fine).  That likely explains why I never use the Automapper Linq stuff, configurations, or even a complex Map.  So I won\\\'t pay attention to much of it in the API and I\\\'m not going to advocate for it.  I realize that others use it.  Please balance this. So with my 2 simple use cases in mind... The convention I enjoy with Automapper is quite simply that Automapper is a black box and it just works.  I don\\\'t want to dig around with Configurations or Factories or Expression Builders. In fact, I wish we could use implied maps for those prototyping and throwaway projects (and Automapper could internally create the maps and cache them) And then for those production projects where we really should call CreateMap: That is the sum-total of how I want to interact with AutoMapper.  It covers 95% of my code on all the many projects that I have used AutoMapper for. Building off of what I wrote above, when we need to get involved with a factory or configurations for those more complex, advanced use cases, I would like to advocate for these variations: For those advanced use-cases, I\\\'m really not speaking as a user of an advanced configuration.  When I saw mention of the words, Factory and Configuration in the snippets about this enhancement, I thought I should throw in my 2-cents and advocate for a cleaner path.  I was looking at [this, in part]url  as well as some of the snippets above. Many thanks for the great library.  I hope to someday meet you in person Jimmy.\''

Execute this with a SQL profiler and you\'ll see what\'s going on. Pretend you didn\'t have AutoMapper or DTOs or anything. Just your EF models. EF supports this recursion through lazy loading. Every time you access a child property, it fetches that second level through an additional query. If you turn lazy loading off, you have to explicitly call Include with EF.

AutoMapper,1414,closed,body,2016-06-30 15:26:49,00:00,1,,,b'b\' In the 4.x timeframe," I removed a feature called ""Formatters"". Formatters were a way for you to modify the value of a string", and they stacked on top of each other. We were using it on a project and it was a horrible idea, BUT I think the general idea might be valid. Type converters globally apply to everything to go from Type A to B, and value resolvers work with individual properties, but nothing really allows you to selectively apply a modifier between resolution and assignment. Our mapping today works like: Where the resolving could be a value resolver, a MapFrom, a member chain, hardcoded value etc. But there\\\'s nothing that lets you take the value from resolving and apply any transforms. Maybe this is called a transform? Anyway, the idea is similar to formatters. I killed them originally because they were horribly slow (now could be fast), and our team was horrrrrribly abusing them. Transformers are like type converters, but can be applied to non-type-map contexts:MembersProfilesConfiguration And at the Configuration level, we can apply conditions to them. Modifiers would be applied first at the member, then profile, then configuration level. You can\\\'t opt-out, you\\\'d need to segregate by profiles or add a condition.

AutoMapper,1414,closed,1,2016-06-30 15:26:49,226.62,,1,,"b'b"" I would think maybe what you want to do is make this based on that only apply to the Profiles and nothing else.  I guess you could modify on Members", and configuration is just the default profile. Then you can make the API use this to take and make an that looks for those types in an assignable expression and then ReplaceParameters of assign from destination.  This example needs some tweaking in what you want to do but the idea is there.Also for type map modifies this could use the same based code except check the base class the properties are coming from and see if they match too.  I don\'t like this idea because they can just use MapFrom to get the same result. Then from that you make all these populate a PostExpressionVisitors list that gets applied to every type map in a profile when TypeMapPlanBuilder builds the expression out.  The PostExpressionVisitors can be exposed in  , but not recommended except for advance usages.  Advance usages might be things like remove Try Catches, remove null checks," and maybe add  map globally for debugging purposes.""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But I\\\'m using litebd (from @mbdavid) andorder by it\\\'s a delegate. Btw, I really need to translate the delegates because the repository isaccessed through dependence injection, or, in another words, there\\\'s noreference to application types, even the structure of models being the sameas domain. I\\\'m using DDD specification for my app design. When I use expression trees,expressionsource and destiny. But with a delegate, I can change which field I\\\'ll use in order by. I knowthe type t_model from source and destiny, but I don\\\'t know what is thet_value type. Got it? Thank u. [],Regards.

My suggestion is to do something like Expressions// Will translate it into a domain expression and then into T-SQL query.var orderByResult =().For().OrderBy(orderByExpression); or you can map the expressions yourself.

You would have make expression and translate it, THEN compile it if you wanted AutoMapper handle translation.  If it\'s passed as a delegate AM should find it\'s type and map off of that.  And if you know that you should be able to get it to get the result type from it and then use that to map over to an expression.  You will have to use reflection to figure out what the field is.

AutoMapper,2317,closed,body,2017-09-13 16:19:27,00:00,,1,,"b'b"" For years I\'ve been hesitant about using AutoMapper because of its indirect nature: somewhere in one big file there\'re all the mappings and it\'s not clear what\'s going on when you read the method that uses Map. Introducing Profiles improved this a lot as now we can at least group mappings into groups.  Recently I\'ve been looking into Jimmy\'s [ContosoUniversityCore project]url  and realised mappings are not getting reused as for every action there\'s one  and one handler. So it makes no sense to store mappings together in a Profile file common for the whole feature. Mapping belongs to the file with  and handler. Jimmy seems to agree with this: url But what is the best way to implement it? Of course we could add a Profile class right next to  and Handler but it seems to be an overkill for simple scenarios: So 6 decorative lines just to add a one-line mapper.  What might be a better solution to this specific problem is adding inline mappers. In the example above I just took [this handler]url  and added one line that CreatesMap.  This approach (specific syntax is debatable) would solve the indirection that bothered me about AutoMapper for years. Here\'s the mapping definition", right where it gets used. It\'s as clear as writing manual mappings but you don\'t have to write repetitive code: the best from both worlds.  I assume different kinds of inline mappings were discussed multiple times during AutoMapper development and there should be good reasons why it hasn\'t been implemented (or am I missing something?). Implementations thoughts: CreateMap should check if this mapping has already added and don\'t add it again," so there should not be a huge overhead;  doesn\'t have to be static: we could inject mapper in some form.

But then you coooooompletely lose the ability to do one-line testing of mapping configuration  . Half the reason AutoMapper exists is to make it easy to test your configuration that you\\\'ve not misspelled anything or accidentally left a member there, or a dozen other things that could happen.  This might be an interesting use case if by default we validated the mappings the first time it ran (and provided a special overload, like InlineMap etc)\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Let\'s imagine we have a Handler with manual mappings. Would you test mappings specifically? No, you would test the handler\'s input and output that\'s what matters. So if there\'s something wrong with the mapping, the Handler\'s test will let you know about it. If you don\'t write tests for your Handlers, lack of  is the last problem you have (and mappings are supposed to be simple anyways, right?).  I agree," both approaches might be beneficial for different scenarios but there\'s definitely the use case for inline mappings.

AutoMapper,2317,closed,8,2017-09-13 16:19:27,367.7,1,,,"b'b\' I would suggest and make a convention that follows the logic of the handlers.  For @jbogard\\\'s example Like Namespace has to be ""."" + EFClass namespace and inherit from IRequest. will make a default mapping.  If you need something more specific you create a profile class to show the more complicated logic in that class.  Mostly it should be simple and the convention should suffice", but if you see a profile that means you had to do something more specific in the mapping, or an indication someone didn\\\'t follow the convention you want to adhere to.  The Convention will be in a separate file independent of the mappings, but it\\\'s a general rule that you should follow, and should work for most if not all scenarios.  Just like how EntityFramework has some default rules.  Like Id or ClassNameID will default it to an Auto Incriminating Primary Key, and if you want something different you will have to manually configure it with configuration code on the DataContext, or with Attributes.  If you want everything to follow Mediator pattern in ContosoUniversityCore example then you would want all names to match and be correct everywhere.  With a convention then if it didn\\\'t work exactly as you specified it should, then you or someone else did something wrong, and they should follow the pattern to fix it, or make a profile and be punished with ugly code for not following the rules.  It\\\'s a trade off, but saves you even more lines of code.\'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I\'m looking at the codebase that I\'m refactoring and I see it\'s done in an ugly way: DataContext is resolved at StartUp and is used for those kinds of mappings," though perfectly a PerThread DataContext should be used.

With this feature we also might improve the way how dependencies are injected. Currently at usage time you have to push a variable with the same name as the variable introduced during mapping registration. I hope we can agree it\'s not the most beautiful part of AutoMapper design. With local dynamic mappings we have exactly the variable we want to inject (i. e. _dataContext variable of a Command), so we can do it in a strongly-typed manner. The only question to me is how to tell AutoMapper not to use the variable itself (as we don\'t want this specific _dataContext to be reused for different queries) but just keep the name of it and retrieve it from the local context.

How do you guarantee that they are getting generated first?  What about circular references or MaxDepth and all those?  You kinda need to know what all the mappings configurations are before you can generate an execute path for it.  Otherwise you probably get an exception trying to create the execution path or running it for the first time.  This probably won\'t happen in you as you could account for it.

First", I tried to change up the by having a real for the enum to map to, and methods for the properties that I actually want to see:   This would be an acceptable workaround for me because the ultimate goal is to serialize these object to JSON. I can just instruct the JSON formatter to ignore the property. I can also just stick directly into my DTO with no special handling.  Unfortunately this doesn\'t work. When trying to project this mapping, we get an exception:  The error message doesn\'t make a lot of sense to me, but I tried just doing a LINQ query directly:   This also fails, and gives a slightly more meaningful exception:   So it looks like mapping enums to is out of the running.  ## Something that actually works. It\'s hackish, and you\'ll have to do it for every enum in a DTO you want to use it on, so it\'s not simple to just drop in, but it works:   Basically just mapping to the same enum type as usual, and then exposing some properties with methods to have the right types to serialize. It\'s hacky, and I don\'t like it, but it works. I\'m going to use it for now," and hopefully try poking some of the things @lbargaoanu pointed me towards this weekend to see if I can get a better solution. ""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I find that arbitrary (historical reasons probably), so I, for one, am not interested in adding another special case. Now, as for the expectation that you\'re inside a profile and the settings should apply to the  call," that\'s more of a feature request. It doesn\'t seem obvious to me how that would be implemented. It does work by default with constructor mapping because we are careful to maintain this context when calling Map at each step. So I would go that way. cc @jbogard""'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If I configure my Profile with: AllowNullCollections = false I would expect all instances of IMapper, including , to honor that, and return an empty list given a null IEnumerable.  If I configure my Profile with: AllowNullCollections = true I would expect all instances of IMapper, including , to honor that, and return null given a null IEnumerable.  It feels both unintuitive and unpredictable if  uses the CreateMaps from my Profile, but not the AllowNullCollections (and other) configs from the same Profile!

Also," I do believe that the AutoMapper documentation should include a BIG WARNING that  behaves differently than the ""normal"" IMapper instance.  Replacing optional parameters with extra constructors might work if you only have one or two parameters. We have more", so that wasn\\\'t an option for us. Also, constructor mapping feels a bit unpredictable to me. In a DDD solution, I want to be 100% sure that my domain objects cannot be created without running all validation which is in the constructor.  So, I instead kept the existing mapping (ConvertUsing and ) but wrote an extension method that returns null for empty IEnumerables.
