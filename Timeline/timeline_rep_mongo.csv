As you can imagine, for the last few months we have been hard at work completing feature development for the 3.4 release. We are now entering a stabilization period in which we are focused on quality and performance, which is a much better time for code cleanup such as this. If you post an updated version of this change, rebased on a recent revision of the master branch, I would be happy to review. Best,"Dave'""",,,,,

We are currently entering a stabilization period for the MongoDB 3.4 release, so we will be unlikely to accept changes of this kind of the next few months. If you would like to revisit, however, feel free to open a new PR. Again, apologies for the delay in getting to this! Best,"Dave'""",,,,
