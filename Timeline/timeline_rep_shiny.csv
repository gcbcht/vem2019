If you want to disable the grey-on-invalidation mechanism", just add this line to your function, which injects the appropriate css into your app:   Although, the  grey-on-invalidation mechanism (flashing) is actually meaningful. The plots become grey the moment they are invalidated (which in your case means when has changed), so their current display is not up to date, but they also have not finished recalculating for the new value of  . You can speed up recalculation (as it seems you\'ve already done by parallelizing your code), but never completely get rid of it. So removing this mechanism actually removes information from  end user, as you now don\'t have any way to know if the plot is still up to date or if it\'s recalculating for the next value... I understand the  may be annoying, but I just want to make sure you understand why it\'s happening. ### A couple of other things:  you don\'t need the super-assign operator ( ); you can stick to for this (unless there\'s something about that necessitates this, but since you use in the first app, that doesn\'t seem to be the case).  I don\'t there is an actual memory leak: in the first app, you don\'t take a dependency on inside the code. So, Shiny never invalidates that expression. Instead, it keeps calculating plots over and over again, never freeing up the previous ones.  This becomes extremely obvious when you run the following app that makes the same mistake, and then look at its reactive log.   Here are the instruction for doing so:  1. Restart your R session and then enter  2. Run the following app:       I clicked the button 4 times times. I recommend you stick with an equally small number  3. Exit the app.  4. Enter at the console. This will open up a new tab in your browser and show you how each Shiny element relates to one another in your app as time moves forward (use the right arrow key for this). If you go through the trouble of dragging and dropping the nodes so that the graph is intelligible, you should end up with something like:  ![reactlog]url   As you can see there are FIVE objects, instead of just one. This is what is holding up the memory. You need to invalidate the previous object, rather than reassign something else to the same variable. You seem to be thinking in an imperative paradigm, while Shiny follows a reactive paradigm...  5. Now if you run the correct version of the same app:       The you will see, that the reactlog is much neater, and in fact, you do only have one object, as you\'d expect from the beginning.  - Hope this was helpful," but I\'d really recommend watching [Joe\'s tutorial about Effective Reactive Programming]url  to avoid getting bitten by this sort of thing in the future.

If the stars align, and your slider always divides evenly by the same number, the last range looks, rightfully, like every other range in the slider:     2. If the last range is smaller than the rest (i.e. it doesn\'t divide evenly by the same number as the other ranges), but it does divide evenly by least two of the smaller subsections, you get the following:     3. However, there are still plenty of situations (like the slider in url  when the last range does not divide evenly.

shiny,1953,closed,2,2018-02-23 15:46:29,41.05,1,,,b'b\' The random seed handling can be slightly different inside a Shiny application. Here\\\'s a summary of the issue," as I understand it: R has an ""true"" internal random seed", which it uses for random number generation, and it has a publicly visible face for the random seed, which is the variable accessible from R. Those two are not always in sync.  When you write C code that uses R\\\'s internal RNG, you need to call in order to copy the internal seed over to the variable. Similarly, calling will copy the over to the internal seed. See url  for more about this.  Rcpp puts a veneer over this so users (usually) don\\\'t have to do anything special. Usually when you call an Rcpp C++ function, it calls to copy over to the internal seed. When it exits that function, it calls copy the intenral seed to  . However, if that Rcpp function calls more functions, it won\\\'t run or because Rcpp [keeps track]url of the call depth.  In the case of your shiny app, the function is called by Rcpp, so when is called, it\\\'s already in an Rcpp function call, and doesn\\\'t bother to call or when entering or exiting  .  In your code, if you call at the beginning of your function and right before returning, it will fix the problem. I don\\\'t think you need to get rid of the Rcpp attributes for that to work. \'',,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Right, @asardaes?  Any user R code that ever runs in httpuv or Shiny is being called back from Rcpp; the web server is written in C after all. So we have all probably been relying on randomization and callbacks of R functions; but few people probably care that their results are reproducible inside of and outside of a Shiny app.  @eddelbuettel I think we should start by trying to work around this in ," and if we\'re not successful there (or learn enough to make a useful suggestion) then we\'ll loop back with you.

shiny,2079,closed,body,2018-05-30 13:50:39,00:00,,1,,b'b\' I would like to request that an additional parameter be added to hoverOpts and plot interaction control functions interacting with plot_output and image_output. This parameter will control the units assigned to the x y values returned by input$plot_hover, input$plot_click etc values. Currently this is assumed based on the output function plot_output or image_output. with plot_output, the units are in the same units as the data, and with image_output the units are in pixels and based on location of the mouse. I am using treemap data and I need to associate the mouse location with one of the boxes in the treemap. treemap software will calculate the coordinates of the boxes, however, when I plot a treemap using plot_output," i receive x/y coordinates in terms of the data and this is not useful. I would like to be able to define the units as ""data"" or ""pixel"" as a parameter of the hoverOpts function. This way I can get pixel location using the plot_output function. I then can use the pixel coordinate together with the coordinates the treemap software calculates to identify which box the user has selected. With this I can then do complex follow up calculation for the user based on the box selected in the plot. something like hoverOpts(id = NULL", delay = 300," delayType = c(""debounce""","throttle""),  clip = TRUE, nullOutside = TRUE, unitsType = c(""data","pixels""))\''
